I eventually drifted closer to empirical Econometrics; but, as it often happens, I didn't end up completing my doctorate. A feeling that I wouldn't be fulfilled by an academic career built in me for a while, and I pivoted to a freelance business — in social media, events, and translation. I missed the clarity, the universal shared language of numbers; but enjoyed connecting the dots between people, my new faster-paced work tempo, and being much closer to the beating heart of business.</p>\n",

      "<p>After a few years, I found myself working for a global online travel agent in a sales/operations role — and realized I was spending a lot of my time creating reporting and finding ways to access and apply data to drive business and measure success. And I loved it. I eventually became a data analyst full-time. As someone new to data operations in tech, I spent months learning and listening — how are people using data? What are their complaints? What successes do they attribute to analytics, what do they only dream of being able to measure — and how could we work together? I was back to connecting dots in a fast-paced environment, at the root of the business, while seeking (and ever so rarely, finding) clarity in numbers. I'd found my middle ground: a role, an area that I truly thrive in.</p>\n",

Indeed, many ideas for data science work were thrown around when the team was formed. Because Demet and I wanted our work to be proactive and influential, we suggested a long-term marketing data science project: <b>RR++ (Increase Retention Rates)</b>. This post is a high-level overview of the story of RR++ and the lessons we learned while working on it. <a href=\"http://data.blog/2019/06/10/using-ml-for-campaign-optimization-our-journey-to-marketing-science-at-automattic/\">Our work on RR++ eventually led to the formation of a new Marketing Science team focused on using data and machine learning to optimize marketing campaigns.</a></p>\n",
