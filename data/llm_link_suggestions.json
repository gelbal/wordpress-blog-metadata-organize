According to a popularly cited study by <a href=\"http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1002/jclp.1151?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1\">Norcross in 2002</a>, only 64% of 150 participants who had made resolutions were able to stick with them beyond a month. <a href=\"http://data.blog/2017/12/26/do-new-years-resolutions-work-data-suggests-they-do/\">However, data suggests that New Year's resolutions may actually work when it comes to blogging</a>. A recent <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/1222-being-a-better-person-tops-list-of-2017-resolutions/\">Marist poll</a> lists some popular choices for New Year&#8217;s resolutions. Among them, being a better person, losing weight, and exercising more ranked high among the thousand or so respondents. I began to wonder: are WordPress.com users showing any observable trends surrounding New Year&#8217;s resolutions? When I have questions about content across all of WordPress.com, I turn to our Elasticsearch Index!</p>\n\nExplanation: I inserted a link to the second post early in the first paragraph, where it naturally fits with the discussion about the effectiveness of New Year's resolutions. This provides readers with additional context about resolution success rates, specifically for blogging.\n\nFor the second post:\n\n<p>Many people, especially in the Western Hemisphere, make New Year&#8217;s resolutions. Some of those resolutions are about blogging. Indeed, blogging is a great way to perform personal introspection, it&#8217;s a professional development aid, and a way to connect with like-minded people all over the internet.

I eventually drifted closer to empirical Econometrics; but, as it often happens, I didn't end up completing my doctorate. A feeling that I wouldn't be fulfilled by an academic career built in me for a while, and I pivoted to a freelance business \u2014 in social media, events, and translation. I missed the clarity, the universal shared language of numbers; but enjoyed connecting the dots between people, my new faster-paced work tempo, and being much closer to the beating heart of business.</p>\n\n<p>After a few years, I found myself working for a global online travel agent in a sales/operations role \u2014 and realized I was spending a lot of my time creating reporting and finding ways to access and apply data to drive business and measure success. And I loved it. I eventually became a data analyst full-time. As someone new to data operations in tech, I spent months learning and listening \u2014 how are people using data? What are their complaints? What successes do they attribute to analytics, what do they only dream of being able to measure \u2014 and how could we work together? I was back to connecting dots in a fast-paced environment, at the root of the business, while seeking (and ever so rarely, finding) clarity in numbers. I'd found my middle ground: a role, an area that I truly thrive in.</p>\n\n<p>I joined Automattic about a year and a half ago, following the recommendation of a friend \u2014now colleague \u2014 of mine. I found the transparency, the dedication to open source, and distributed work very appealing, and saw working in a remote team as a fantastic way to grow as an analyst and a professional overall. I now lead the central reporting and infrastructure team I'd originally joined in 2019, and I couldn't be more excited about our mission to empower business leaders at Automattic to make the right choices about the right things, with confidence. <a href=\"http://data.blog/2023/03/08/women-of-datamattic-anna-elek/\">You can read more about my journey and experiences as Head of Data at Automattic in this interview</a>",

In this post, you will learn what A/B tests are and how our internal tool makes them easier.</p>\n\n<p>Every A/B test is an experiment, similar to ones used to prove that a new medicine benefits patients. When the feature or change is ready to ship we initiate an A/B test where users are randomly divided into two groups, usually called <b>test</b> and <b>control</b>. For the duration of the test, only the users in the test group see the new feature or change. We use the data to make an informed decision about whether the test version performs better and should be made available to all users, or whether it underperforms the original and we need to go back to the drawing board to test new hypotheses.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine, for example, that we wanted to know whether a localized greeting on the homepage is a good idea. We could test for an increase in the number of accounts created. During the A/B test, we would show the localized greeting only to a randomly selected subset of homepage visitors: a visitor from Texas would be greeted with <i>Howdy!</i> if they were assigned to the test group, and with a simple <i>Hi!</i> if they were assigned to the control group. During the A/B test, we count the number of users who visit the homepage and the number of users who create an account in each of the two groups, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>How can we infer whether the new feature improves our conversion rate from the data we collected? Can we draw this conclusion if six out 10 vs. five out 10 users converted with and without the new feature, respectively? An",

As we got started, one important question loomed for me and my teammate Demet Dagdelen: <i>What should we data scientists do as part of this team?</i></p>\n<p>Even though the term <i>data science</i> has been heavily used in the past few years, its meaning still lacks clarity. <a href=\"https://yanirseroussi.com/2018/07/22/defining-data-science-in-2018/\">My current definition for data science</a> is: \"<i>a field that deals with description, prediction, and causal inference from data in a manner that is both domain-independent and domain-aware, with the ultimate goal of supporting decisions.</i>\" This is a very broad definition that offers a vague direction for what <i>marketing </i>data scientists should do. Indeed, many ideas for data science work were thrown around when the team was formed. Because Demet and I wanted our work to be proactive and influential, we suggested a long-term marketing data science project: <b>RR++ (Increase Retention Rates)</b>. This post is a high-level overview of the story of RR++ and the lessons we learned while working on it. <a href=\"http://data.blog/2019/06/10/using-ml-for-campaign-optimization-our-journey-to-marketing-science-at-automattic/\">Our work on RR++ eventually led to the formation of a new Marketing Science team focused on using data and machine learning to optimize marketing campaigns.</a></p>\n\nExplanation: I inserted a link to the target post near the end of the second paragraph, where the author is discussing the RR++ project.
