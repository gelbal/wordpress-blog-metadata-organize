    "content": "\n<p>This post highlights specific data conferences and talks recently recommended by Automatticians (employees at Automattic).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying informed is key in the fast-evolving field of data science. At Automattic, we value continuous learning and regularly attend conferences and talks that advance our understanding and skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post shares a curated list of events and talks that have particularly stood out, as recommended by fellow Automatticians. Whether you&#8217;re deeply embedded in data work or just starting out, these recommendations are proven to inspire and educate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let\u2019s talk about conferences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/aetherunbound\">Madison</a> is an experienced data engineer at Automattic, and she shared some wonderful suggestions for conferences:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://pydata.org/seattle2023/\"><strong>PyData Seattle</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I attended this conference because I have worked with data in Python over my entire career, and it was great to have a venue geared specifically towards that!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While Python was the common thread throughout this conference, a number of other technologies and tools were discussed\u2014R, Spark, Elasticsearch, and SQL. The workshops the day before the main event were particularly engaging and useful. I had much to take away from the conference and bring back to my team and my work.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I believe this is a recurring event, though I haven\u2019t heard any announcement about a 2024 event.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I did give a talk about <a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">Openverse</a> (a search engine for openly licensed media) at this event: <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/R0YqPAhKMhs?si=H2tek9Lxw_ZLDsL6\">Madison Swain-Bowden \u2013 Managing a search engine for over 600 million openly licensed media records</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://airflowsummit.org/\"><strong>Airflow Summit</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This is a yearly conference based around the workflow management tool Airflow.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I use Airflow in my work, volunteering, and personal life, so attending a conference dedicated to the project was a wonderful experience. It was excellent to connect with folks who both use and build the project, see how they\u2019re overcoming hurdles, and find out more about the project&#8217;s future.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This is a recurring event, and the next edition is happening this September in San Francisco!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I\u2019ve spoken at several Airflow Summits in the past:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/ja2siGyklq0?si=V9eQ1JJDXaDxcOFH\">Dataclasses as Pipeline Definitions in Airflow</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/z_BkpAA0RkA?si=2__dhuTBrp_EmFij\">Forging the Future: Five years of fabricating with Airflow by Madison Swain-Bowden</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.widspugetsound.org/\"><strong>Women in Data Science: Puget Sound</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This is a yearly conference in the US Pacific Northwest area for women &amp; non-binary folks in data science &amp; data-related roles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>As a woman in the data space, attending an event dedicated to gender minorities in my field is such a breath of fresh air. We share so many struggles and joys; having a platform to share them is wonderful!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This is a recurring event, next happening on May 14th this year in Seattle.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I haven\u2019t spoken at this conference before, but I will speak this year about Airflow and will also be on a panel about women\u2019s empowerment in leadership positions!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let\u2019s talk about talks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My colleague <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/firatgelbal\">Firat</a>, an Analytics Engineer, shared the following talks:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/_mZBa3sqTrI?si=IGEpMKDTR4HC1p0G\"><strong>Plain Text \u2013 Dylan Beattie \u2013 NDC Oslo 2021</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dylan Beattie is an excellent speaker! He generally presents entertaining and insightful talks. In this talk, he provides a pretty comprehensive history of text encoding in software engineering. I didn\u2019t expect that I\u2019d laugh so much while learning new things about text encoding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umw8X5umHyw\"><strong>Igor Khrol: How to Test BigData/ETL Solutions?</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me share this great presentation from <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/khroliz\">@khroliz</a> highlighting the thought put into our tech stack and the architecture of SQLT, the internal framework Automattic uses to transform SQL. We use this for much of our internal work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2023/how-to-use-data-contracts-for-data-quality-in-your-airflow-ecosystem/\"><strong>How to use Data Contracts for Data Quality in your Airflow Ecosystem</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Shirshanka Das is one of the minds behind <a href=\"https://datahubproject.io/\">the DataHub project</a>. In this talk, he explains how the team uses Data Contracts as part of the DataHub to improve data quality. I found it informative. I also liked his product demo as part of the talk and seeing the practical side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other resources</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress TV</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/jqnavarro\">Joaqu\u00edn</a>, a Data Librarian, suggested <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=data\">WordPress TV</a>. It\u2019s an outstanding resource teeming with knowledge, covering a vast array of subjects not just limited to the WordPress open-source project, but extending to numerous aspects of web publishing and content distribution, and, of course, data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://confs.tech/data\">Finding more tech conferences (online tool)</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An excellent resource for additional conferences is <a href=\"https://confs.tech/data\">https://confs.tech/data</a>. This tool allows you to search for in-person (by topic or location) and online conferences on various topics, including data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Learning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may be obvious that learning is important, it\u2019s very easy to get busy with daily work and forget about attending conferences, listening to talks, or generally learning from experts in the field. The best way to ensure that learning is part of your focus is to include it in your professional goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One approach that has worked quite well for some teams at Automattic is to make learning a team goal. For example, a team might set a goal to attend a certain number of conferences per quarter or listen to a talk and share insights. This makes it easier for the entire team to participate and encourages learning from one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What has your experience been like attending talks and conferences? Have you found a good way to share what you learned with your team?&nbsp;</p>\n",

The <a href=\"https://www.neurodiversityweek.com/\">neurodiversity movement</a> aims to value that diversity and embrace difference. In 2023, we asked members of Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"https://automattic.com/automattician-resource-groups/\">neurodiversity ERG</a>, &#8216;Neurodiverseomattic&#8217;, the question &#8220;<strong>What\u2019s one thing you wish neurotypical people understood about your neurodivergence?</strong>&#8221; Here were their answers! <a href=\"https://automattic.com/diversity-and-inclusion/\">Read more about diversity, equity and inclusion at Automattic here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">That I can&#8217;t just try harder and snap out of it.</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"line-height:1.4;flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-medium-font-size is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">If you ask me a question, by default I&#8217;ll most probably try to answer it honestly and to the fullest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/pexels-leeloo-the-first-5428826.jpg\" alt=\"A question mark on crumpled paper\" class=\"wp-image-3885\" style=\"width:130px;height:194px\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Photo from <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/question-mark-on-crumpled-paper-5428826/\">Pexels.com</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/pexels-matheus-bertelli-1830252.jpg\" alt=\"A hand holding a sparkly lightbulb\" class=\"wp-image-3886\" style=\"aspect-ratio:0.6684350132625995;width:271px;height:auto\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Photo from <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-holding-light-bulb-with-string-lights-inside-1830252/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pexels.com</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The fact that there are things I struggle with, that usually fall to a manager to help resolve, doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m incompetent and need managerial hand-holding.

    "content": "\n<p><em>&#8220;Is it possible to transform a role in customer support into a data science career?&#8221;&nbsp; </em>This question, which once seemed like a distant dream, became my career blueprint at Automattic. My journey from a Happiness Engineer in September 2014 to a data wrangler today is a tale of continuous evolution, learning, and adaptation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in the dynamic world of customer support with team &#8220;Hermes&#8221; (an internal team name that does not mean much except for being fun), I not only adapted to the challenges of working remotely but also embraced the complexities of supporting<a href=\"https://wordpress.com\"> WordPress.com</a> users and websites. I embraced various challenges, from a mobile support rotation with <a href=\"https://www.helpshift.com/\">Helpshift</a> for<a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/mobile/\"> our mobile apps</a>, to a stint with the Terms of Service team, to forming the first team to provide Live Chat support along with tickets on<a href=\"https://wordpress.com\"> WordPress.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest hurdle for each of these rotations was not just understanding technical issues but also mastering the art of empathetic, effective communication. Each support ticket was not just a problem to be solved; it was an opportunity to connect with a human being and improve their online experience (and maybe their life and business, as well).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m thankful that Automattic provides opportunities to rotate into new divisions, roles, and product lines to expand one&#8217;s skill set and familiarize oneself with more of our products. Over the last decade, I was fortunate to go through multiple rotations that helped me gain new skills while contributing to Automattic in new ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I ventured through rotations in<a href=\"https://jetpack.com\"> Jetpack</a> and<a href=\"https://woo.com\"> WooCommerce</a>, my curiosity about data analytics began to sprout. I was fascinated by how data could influence decisions and drive improvements. The transition to a career in data was not smooth; I often found myself overwhelmed by the technicalities of data science. But my determination to grow led me to overcome these challenges through continuous learning and practical application.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/OC8eGdUdKWRi2qQfj6BxTADnmlIEhEqN4Q5dVnRGg5aacVuadYV-0RBQUyjkeyx4bUDmpemmZmNXsENWGyEIWidgXrlHYgzOxirMO11JCMjW0xyBS8Gfnu1qVXm8-jJrsETfFJExo_myc0-pcoJdRcI\" alt=\"Illustration showing a transition from customer support to data analytics.

The right side shows a person analyzing data with graphs and charts on a computer screen, amidst data visualizations and statistical tools. The background is a smooth transition from a support desk to a data science workspace.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Embracing Leadership and Project Management</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Progressing in my career, I assumed more leadership roles. In my leadership role on Team Artemis, I faced one of my most significant challenges: managing a diverse, global team across time zones. I was the lead of the first UTC++ team (a mix of European and Asia time zones). The complexity of coordinating and leading such a diverse group taught me invaluable lessons in cross-cultural communication and team dynamics. It was during this time that the importance of data in making informed decisions became clear to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A primary goal during this time was to expand our company&#8217;s coverage to 24/7 in live chat and tickets, which highlighted a clear need: more people in Europe and Asia to ensure round-the-clock coverage. This led me to join the hiring team to support them in this mission for almost three years. My time with hiring solidified my project management skills, such as providing critical feedback and making impactful decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I continued to lead Artemis, and as the team grew, we split into dedicated teams: one covering Europe, which I continued to lead, and another focusing on APAC time zones, which one of my team members from Asia took over as a lead, and in which they placed me as a leadership coach.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CU493DmDaDSt5ucNhcAl59MFwzbs1rMalPo2gY1M6zC2wCZO8hcKNaQc1ny2liSneUV9G5ttQSJg4fjgJVzSiVa17oJYAXVEXH_da1cwNTElLKvslpPqsboRa9RFgvhdWwAi_wZMWQGXX3tZJ6rZZms\" alt=\"Image depicting a career growth pathway. The pathway is lined with symbols for different career stages, including a headset for customer support, a computer with code for data analysis, books and certificates for learning, and a trophy for achievements. The path leads towards a bright horizon, symbolizing future career opportunities and growth in a light and inspiring atmosphere.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Venturing into Data: A Natural Progression</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, my shift toward data began subtly. Being involved in guilds like the Ticket Guild, which analyzes ticket availability and reports monthly stats, sparked my interest in data analytics. This interest deepened with the Testing Guild (which aimed to test new features and report bugs by priority); it deepened even further when I became a team lead and started seeing the power of data in decision-making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At work, our responsibilities continued to expand, requiring us to start doing proactive sales, tracking more numbers across various support mediums, and using tools like<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker\"> Looker</a> and<a href=\"https://superset.apache.org/\"> Superset</a> to oversee teams\u2019 and divisions\u2019 performance. We had <em>a lot of spreadsheets</em>, too. Performance conversations, decisions, and prioritization of product bugs were all driven by data. Over time, it became evident that for my impact to grow, my ability to perform data analysis had to grow as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout my tenure as a team lead, I had managed various projects, with the most recent ones being Customer Education, which includes all of our public<a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/\"> documentation</a>,<a href=\"https://wordpress.com/webinars\"> webinars</a>, creating<a href=\"https://wordpress.com/learn/courses/\"> courses</a>, and even online live events like<a href=\"https://wpgrowthsummit.com/\"> WP Growth Summit</a>; and the Scope of Support Project, focusing on evaluating support time per product domain and medium to make process and product improvements. None of them would be doable without a strong reliance on data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realizing my growing passion for data, I took the initiative to upskill myself. I completed over 30 classes in <a href=\"https://datacamp.com\">DataCamp</a>, covering topics from <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-analyst-in-sql\">SQL</a> to <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-professional-with-python\">Python</a>, and dabbled in <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-visualization-with-python\">visualization</a>, <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell\">shell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git\">git</a>, <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-statistics\">statistics</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/case-studies-in-statistical-thinking\">analytical thinking</a>. This formal education was crucial in gaining practical experience and transitioning to more data-centric roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/fqp8OLeZSvm9S-C77Jyk3XNRTokEQPaSHQHbgPliPORnK7bVWaNCAO64t1GHhAQJw5NW0pnEhu3rjkHSuECLji9jnWddAObAuy-Pu_oZdUvBcwY3-RK6W_kuJLmrfucOOd4LsLUwICvGAJj50Ptob7c\" alt=\"Modern illustration of a desk evolving from customer support to data science.

The application process was challenging, <a href=\"https://data.blog/2022/11/21/how-to-profit-from-an-analytics-skill-matrix/\">requiring knowledge</a> of <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python</a>, using <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter Notebooks</a>, and deriving insights from sample data. Fortunately, my experience with WordPress publishing and engagement metrics was beneficial. A couple of weeks into the trial, I secured a spot! \ud83c\udf89</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve been tackling tasks and projects aiming to improve our organization, documentation, and efficiency, while continuing to be part of a service team to all my colleagues across various divisions, answering data requests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being immersed in Tumblr&#8217;s world of data has been a humbling experience. Since getting the role, I have continued to expand my SQL and Python knowledge. My prior experience as a front-end user of tools like Looker and Superset paid off and has since expanded. I began creating my own dashboards and charts to help answer various questions and positively influence product decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ir0Yx0vNWELLFScf14MWUHzlG4xhM33iurLsp_sLA-t6rgh1lO9U_Z56q6XdjaWvzULm8-qtAXlONOBnJTbkzoJ7MJVKXJ6qeQDSzfxG3-jQorxtmxUC_UMG7Y3Fl6izAj62CNS_d5CJuOUtYkhixT4\" alt=\"Screenshot of a data analytics dashboard interface displaying a list of charts, with the dataset information blurred for privacy.

The interface shows options for searching, filtering by favorites, certification, and dataset types. Columns indicate the chart type, the dataset used, and the last modified date, all suggesting a comprehensive analytics environment.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just when things seemed to be settling, another change came: by January 2024, I transitioned to Automattic&#8217;s Central Data Team, a role that combines servicing Tumblr teams short-term and expanding to the full set of products offered by Automattic, including<a href=\"https://wordpress.com\"> WordPress.com</a>,<a href=\"https://woo.com\"> Woo.com</a>,<a href=\"https://jetpack.com\"> Jetpack.com</a>, and <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">many more</a>! This feels like a culmination of all my experiences and learnings, and it continues to challenge me to grow in my data science career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey of transitioning from customer support to data science has been special, but not unique. It\u2019s a story of continuous learning, adapting, and growing. Each role and project contributed to my understanding of data and its pivotal role in decision-making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I look forward to more challenges and opportunities in a career in data analytics and learning data science, I&#8217;m reminded of the importance of adaptability, <a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/\">continuous learning, and the willingness to dive into uncharted territories</a>.

    "content": "\n<p>Automattic is a <a href=\"https://automattic.com/how-we-work/\">globally distributed company</a> and a few times each year, we come together for a <a href=\"https://distributed.blog/an-automattic-field-guide-to-meetups/\">meetup</a> to align on team strategy and to forge stronger relationships. During these meetups, we tend to work together on various projects, sometimes called \u201chack projects.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These projects bring together people from various backgrounds and divisions to solve a certain problem. This year, I worked with a lovely group of people as part of our data community meetup to figure out a better way to quantify and understand user product feedback that comes through our support requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post, originally authored by George Jeng for our company&#8217;s internal communication forum (</em><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\"><strong><em>P2 Theme</em></strong></a><em>), has been adapted for this public blog. The team members who contributed to the original discussion include Jesse Akes, Stefano Barzaghi, Joao Amaral, Zvonimir Tomas, George Jeng, Matthew Miller, Brian Abelson, and Daniel Danilov.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Problem</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The existing support team at <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> provides users with an <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/support\">online feedback submission form</a>. However, managing the influx of feedback presents a challenge, with daily submissions ranging from 40 to 700 requests. This volume becomes particularly overwhelming when we introduce new features. Consequently, we struggle to effectively comprehend the messages users are sending us, which results in a missed opportunity to gain valuable insights from our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s the goal of this project?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The objective of this project is to create a tool that empowers Tumblr staff to efficiently grasp the essence of incoming feedback. This tool will equip our team with the capability to aggregate and delve deeper into feedback that shares common themes. We aim to provide Tumblr staff with a user-friendly tool for gaining insight into the context of support requests, analyzing requests within specified timeframes, and conducting in-depth exploration of feedback by considering the sentiment of requests and keywords mentioned in the tickets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Proposed Solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To create an all-encompassing dashboard for staff to easily grasp feedback, our overarching approach involves the following key steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Data Categorization:</strong> We will systematically categorize feedback into distinct sentiments and themes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>User-Friendly Filters:</strong> Users will have access to intuitive filters that allow them to sort feedback based on sentiment, themes, and date ranges.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Automated Weekly Reports:</strong> Our system will automate the generation of weekly reports, presenting Tumblr teams with a comprehensive summary of all feedback received during the preceding week.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trend Identification:</strong> We&#8217;ll empower users to identify emerging trends and patterns through insightful visualizations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In seamlessly integrating these components, our goal is to provide staff with a centralized hub for feedback comprehension, ensuring a streamlined and efficient feedback analysis process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What We Did</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/2c_EciqrgK3DcaKnUW6vYsOQVHqKka9Hemcke6jJWsZsxr-aQDm-sajYxqCmt-DVMQbgaP-8i57cNKQF6BuKZv0CRvqnYIiB04Xx4fO6Eb_4IqNJEmIEzUzottIE4AjH2dSFMTasSbmb_guqHhDuSDY\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data Extraction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We pulled out the feedback tickets from Tumblr\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/\">Zendesk</a> instance using <a href=\"https://meltano.com/\">Meltano</a>, and loaded the data into Tumblr\u2019s <a href=\"https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html\">HDFS</a> instance.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Classification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we originally designed this project, we thought we had to create separate processes, respectively, for the sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and summarization. But with the availability of ChatGPT, we were able to consolidate all these processes into one <a href=\"https://jupyter.org\">Jupyter</a> script.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The ChatGPT prompt we used was&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>SYSTEM_PROMPT = &#8220;&#8221;&#8221;<br>You are a helpful AI assistant that classifies Tumblr user feedback based on what features they are talking about.&nbsp; \\You will be given a list of common features and issues that other Tumblr users have talked about.&nbsp; Each feature \\will have a title, a short description of what users have said about that feature, a list of important related \\keywords and a summary of user sentiment about the feature.&nbsp; These will be encoded in a json format.<br>You will then be given a single user comment and you will determine which of those features the user is talking \\about.&nbsp; Respond with exactly the title of the feature as listed.&nbsp; \\If they are not talking about any feature in the list you will respond with &#8220;Other&#8221;.&nbsp; You will also \\determine the sentiment of the user&#8217;s comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>You will:1) Choose the feature from the list that is most related to the user&#8217;s comment.2) Refer to the feature by the exact title that it is given in the list.3) Do not create new features or feature titles.&nbsp;4) If the user&#8217;s comment does not match well with anything in the list of features then use the title &#8220;Other&#8221;.5) Classify the sentiment of the user&#8217;s comment as one of the following:&nbsp; VERY NEGATIVE, SOMEWHAT NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, SOMEWHAT POSITIVE, VERY POSITIVE&nbsp;Respond only in the following json format:<br>{&#8220;feature&#8221;:&lt;Title of the feature they are talking about&gt;,&#8221;sentiment&#8221;:&lt;One of VERY NEGATIVE, SOMEWHAT NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, SOMEWHAT POSITIVE, VERY POSITIVE&gt;}<br>Here is the list of features to choose from:<br>&#8220;&#8221;&#8221; + TOPIC_LIST<br>USER_PROMPT = &#8220;&#8221;&#8221;<br>Here is the user comment for you to classify:<br>{comment}{add list of topics here with additional criteria as necessary}<br>&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Visualization&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of visualizations, we built two prototypes, one in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker\">Looker</a> and the other in <a href=\"https://superset.apache.org/\">Superset</a>. The visualizations below use<strong> a sample dataset</strong> to help provide a realistic representation:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/lZgm9SPF-V6xe4c2RCo-ebfSasBlUHknT08WpAEdObSToN97r4LC-N1kEBiLFx_yxi-6OPsb187VL1D9OdGJo0Kvo2LlhlgqJDyzlW0r5xQckGWt-ZHvRiBHN4BKaWCqIUsf0b0psnjyU4xFCZy8DqI\" alt=\"Image of a Looker dashboard displaying data parsed from customer support feedback.

This dashboard features an array of data visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and area charts, showcasing insights into customer queries, resolution efficiency, and feedback trends</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we learned</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>What\u2019s AI Good For? \u2013 </strong>OpenAI is best used for one-off summarization or simple problems like sentiment analysis. Using it to accomplish sophisticated tasks in a reliable manner is really hard, often due to challenges in understanding complex context, the need for vast, high-quality data, maintaining consistency across each prompt, and limitations in current AI algorithms&#8217; ability to mimic advanced human reasoning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prompts as Programs&nbsp; \u2013 </strong>To prevent unpredictable behavior and ensure reproducible results with AI, It\u2019s best to break prompts down into small pieces. Combine the pieces in logical sequence to create complicated programs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Far Out Dude&nbsp; \u2013</strong> Despite prompting OpenAI to classify comments with specific features and return a strict schema, it still hallucinated new classifications and output formats. This required changing our pipeline to handle these edge cases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Speed Counts</strong> \u2013 In hack projects with tight deadlines, the speed of querying is crucial. When using certain infrastructures, queries can be excessively time-consuming, significantly hindering progress and affecting the project&#8217;s overall efficiency. This delay not only impacts the ability to iterate quickly but also constrains the scope of experimentation and development, which are key in a fast-paced hack environment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Diversity Matters&nbsp; \u2013</strong> Having team members from a variety of backgrounds meant that people responsible for individual parts of the pipeline all had a say in how other parts of the product functioned.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the hack project, we had managed to wrap up a working version of the tool. Our fellow Automatticians have since then expressed excitement about the tool, and also provided us with helpful feedback. Our team ended up winning first place in our internal Hack Week Awards!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, this hack project was a lot of fun and also a great learning experience for everyone. We all feel happy to have contributed to a feedback tool that can impact the future of the product. We hope our customer-driven feedback can help inspire higher productivity, and create a more enjoyable working culture within Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What hack day projects has your team worked on? What did you learn? Please share your thoughts in the comments.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>As a fully distributed company, Automattic has always adopted <a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/communication-is-oxygen/\">a unique, mostly asynchronous way of communication</a>. Among our most widely used communication tools, <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">P2</a> is a WordPress plugin and a platform for teams to discuss ideas, share project reports, and collaborate transparently. You can basically think of it as Automattic\u2019s internal blogging network, where people can both consume and create content that\u2019s relevant to their work. The best part is that it works asynchronously: you can read and write P2s at your own convenient time. In total, the whole company writes about <a href=\"https://automattic.com/about/\">6k P2 posts and 12k P2 comments per week</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this vast amount of information, it can often be challenging if not impossible for every Automattic employee (a.k.a. Automattician) to be on top of everything. Despite the existence of a search engine and a recommender system for P2, Automatticians still experience and report fear of missing out (FOMO) on P2 content. During a hack project at the recent <a href=\"https://data.blog/2022/12/16/automattics-first-data-meetup/\">yearly cross-division data+ meetup</a>, a couple of data and machine learning folks (<a href=\"https://anandnalya.com/\">Anand N.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrii-nikitiuk-45560932/\">Andrii N.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fgelbal/?originalSubdomain=es\">F\u0131rat G.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessie-r-/\">Jessie R.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jie-bao-a328381/?originalSubdomain=de\">Jie B.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlnick/?originalSubdomain=za\">Nick P.</a>) decided to tackle this long standing problem from a data perspective, and came up with a new solution that surfaces more personalized and relevant P2 content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Hack Project</strong>: We ran a hackathon at a recent data-focused cross-division meetup. All participants were split into groups of roughly 5-6 people; each group worked on a predefined project for 3 days. These&nbsp; projects were either related to the day-to-day work of data professionals, or required certain data skills. To encourage cross-team collaboration, we made sure that each group consisted of people from different teams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Automatticians have too many P2 posts to read, and there is a constant fear of missing out, which makes the reader lost and clueless about where to start or stop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A typical P2 reader has usually encountered at least one of the following situations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I never know if I\u2019m done reading P2&#8217;s.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I don\u2019t have a good way of saving P2&#8217;s to read / reference later.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I don\u2019t know what my team or division feels is important.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I don\u2019t know if there is a conversation happening in the comments thread that I\u2019m not aware of.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I don\u2019t know if there is a conversation happening on something I\u2019ve already read or commented on.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When I come back from vacation, I never know what\u2019s important for me to read right away.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover is-style-default\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim\"></span><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-cover-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><strong>The goal</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We aim to build a better way to discover and consume P2s. The new solution would ideally surface all (and only) the most relevant content for each reader,&nbsp; such that they\u2019re able to consume the most important information in a small amount of time, and can be confident that they\u2019re mostly up-to-date after the reading.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Proposed Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There already exists an internal P2 aggregator (called <em>P2 Swarm</em>) that surfaces relevant P2 posts from P2s the reader follows. It, however, has some major pain points. The most common feedback we hear is: the content is not relevant to me; the tool doesn\u2019t remember the content I\u2019ve already read; no explanation of <em>why</em> a certain P2 is recommended to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these problems as our guide, we set out to build a new version of the P2 Swarm tool, where the recommended P2 content is both personalized and updated in real time. The new tool also keeps track of which posts the reader has already seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/V7U8mGRu9VZi6adqxpj7MtOFpRU4QdL93zuga9SkO0S1crn3BSn3YLvD5Vb6Ln2fL7K-x4TP8avtCNzmhuR6AnHZaNBU9Me3YDwhcDZYj-2BnQd0VlJAyH6r6cS1Uvs_lQBWURiA0v9gEM71d6JU2Ic\" alt=\"screenshot of the p2 fomo tool from the hack project\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll dive a bit deeper into individual components in the following.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data sources</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We defined the following three sources as the signals for the recommendations. We retrieve each content stream separately via Elasticsearch queries, and then build a single feed with a weighted mix to do sorting.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Collaborative filtering</strong>: Posts from your followed P2s that were engaged or authored by the most similar readers as you (i.e. they previously engaged on the same P2 posts as you did). This is much like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering\">the classical collaborative filtering algorithm</a> for recommender systems.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>In-network</strong>: P2 posts engaged by people in your network (either from the primary team, e.g. <em>Spirit</em>, or the parent team, e.g. <em>Feeds, Engagement, Notifications</em>). These posts can be from P2s not yet followed by you, and therefore offer a view into what like-minded people as you are reading/talking about.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Globally popular</strong>: The most engaged P2 posts across the whole company. This is to draw readers\u2019 attention to widely popular topics that are potentially relevant to <em>everyone</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Architecture</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All P2 data live on our <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\">Elasticsearch cluster</a>. In addition to posts\u2019 content, Elasticsearch also has the data of likes and comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We make use of the P2 impression data on a separate MySQL database to keep track of the posts already seen by a specific reader. We retrieve the team network data from a Hive table on the <a href=\"https://hadoop.apache.org/\">Hadoop cluster</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our overall architecture makes heavy use of Elasticsearch. This design has the advantage of retrieving real-time engagement data, and producing on-the-fly recommendations. At the same time, it keeps the project well scoped and the tech stack lean.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We built a new UI with different filters on top of an internal dashboarding tool called Mission Control (MC). Like the original P2 Swarm, our new tool, code-named <em>P2 FOMO</em>, accepts optional date range input from the reader to filter the posts by creation date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have the following filters in addition:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>P2s you follow</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Popular posts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Liked by your peers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Posts already seen by you</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The reader has the choice to turn these options on or off to filter the feed content as needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We also added summaries of individual posts to the P2 FOMO UI, by calling a self-hosted <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/llama/\">Llama2 model</a> for text summarization. We iterated on multiple prompts and settled on the following one:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Act as an editor in a news website to create a succinct summary of &lt;post text&gt; and return bullet points.<br><br>- Only respond with the summary and make sure not to provide any extra comments.<br><br>- Use bullet points.<br><br>- If there is any, include the call to action phrase in the summary.<br><br>- The summary is 400 characters max.<br><br>- Ensure to not repeat the same information.</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the latency of generating the post summary is pretty high at the moment, we realized that we need offline processing to prepare the summaries in advance, in order to have a fast loading time of the UI and a smooth user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How we worked</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jessie, our JavaScript guru, helped us set up an iCloud shared folder to sync up content from our local machines, and provided a place where we can all access the code. We split the work in parallel and often ended up shouting out loud what each of us was working on, to make sure we didn\u2019t edit the same file. While this definitely felt primitive and not as productive as the git workflow, it worked relatively well and surprisingly helped boost the team feeling and spirit as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also ran backups and synced every 5 mins, which is sometimes more or less reliable. There were occasions when we got weird errors and realized the code was not synced up, because Jessie\u2019s laptop was offline.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7uwwbCvzuI1nhGV2dUoQOtNhhAwPIrITbAaQPv3IwuvkSKPiUIIc0CGz1-zol3a23p_KkUPDAdqhSTU2JnWZPNwQnHQiJce6wFnRV-AnkIyFIhFd7A2Wbf6qdNDvGCRTKoSysNXjqysx2CVZsbZv150\" alt=\"compiling cartoon, automattic edition, modified from xkcd\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Compiling (Automattic edition, modified from <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/303/\">https://xkcd.com/303/</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the hack project, we managed to wrap up a working version of the P2 recommendation tool, and had deployed it internally. Our fellow Automatticians have since then expressed a large amount of excitement about the tool, and also provided us with some helpful feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting user feedback and &nbsp;ideas for possible follow-up work include recommending personalized comments (in addition to posts), and adding a feature to follow specific users/teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Overall, this hack project was a lot of fun and also a great learning experience for everyone. We all feel happy to have contributed to a communication tool that\u2019s used by the whole company every day. We hope our data-informed feature can add little steps to higher productivity and a more enjoyable working culture within Automattic.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meetups at Automattic</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic has been a <a href=\"https://automattic.com/how-we-work/\">globally distributed company</a> from the start. A few times each year, we come together for a <a href=\"https://distributed.blog/an-automattic-field-guide-to-meetups/\">meetup</a> to align on team strategy and to forge stronger relationships. We\u2019ve found that <strong>organized dinner groups</strong> are a great way to facilitate connections and meet new people from various teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating meetup dinner groups turned out to be an interesting <strong>optimization problem</strong>. The task is to create a schedule such that no two people meet more than once and eat at the same restaurant. At the 2023 Data+ Meetup, my hack group and I created <strong>Dinnermattic</strong>: an internal tool that helps people create dinner groups for their meetups. Here\u2019s how we did it!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-11 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/pxl_20220906_190050563.webp?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3766\"/></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/img_20220910_204101-1.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3786\"/></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/pxl_20220910_101612920.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3791\"/></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Dinner groups at our <a href=\"https://data.blog/2022/12/16/automattics-first-data-meetup/\">2022 Data+ meetup</a> in Madrid, Spain.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding an optimal solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The dinner group problem can be expressed as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_golfer_problem\">social golfer problem</a>: schedule <code>g</code> groups of size <code>s</code> using <code>k</code> golfers over <code>w</code> weeks. Each golfer must play once a week and never play with the same person more than once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combinatorial design problem is challenging because of the large search space: there are a total of <code>w! x g! x s! x k!</code> schedule combinations! Finding an optimal solution is possible, but it often takes a lot of time and memory. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/optimization\">Google OR Tools</a> is often the go-to solver used by many in this field. We implemented the <strong>optimal solution</strong> solver in a Jupyter notebook and it works well, but it can take over 60s to find a solution. Instead of finding the proven optimal solution, we would be happy with getting a <strong>near-optimal solution</strong> in a fraction of the time. Many researchers have used <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm\">genetic algorithms</a> as a practical way of finding good-enough solutions in very fast time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"genetic-algorithms\">Genetic algorithms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The genetic algorithm is a method for solving optimization problems by mimicking biological evolution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://dataplusp2.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/screenshot.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1893\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The algorithm goes as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start with a random permutation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Score each option and filter for the top choices (parents).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create new permutations (generations) by crossing over and mutating the top choices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Score the next generation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check if it is a feasible solution. If so, end. Else, return to step 2.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We implemented the near-optimal solution using a genetic solver and can now get really good solutions in less than a second. What makes genetic solvers so powerful is that they can be applied to many optimization problems, and allow for custom scoring, selection, and crossover depending on the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the <strong>Dinnermattic</strong> genetic solver uses the sum of squared pairwise weights to score a permutation. This scoring technique discourages the same set of people from being assigned to dinners with the same people more than once.

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2023/11/06/synchronizing-data-with-apache-superset-our-internal-solution/",
    "content": "\n<p>It is well known that, at Automattic, we love free and open source software. In fact, we have Automatticians actively contributing to a multitude of open source projects, with the main one being of course: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/automattic/\">WordPress</a>. That\u2019s why, as soon as we verified that the current versions of <a href=\"https://superset.apache.org\">Apache Superset</a> are robust enough to satisfy many of our data visualization needs, we proceeded to install an instance of the software and make it available to every member of our organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installation involved implementing a multitude of configurations, such a sophisticated authentication protocol associated with the data on our intranet and, of course, the connection to our different data sources. As you may imagine, it was a most entertaining job for our efficient data engineers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we\u2019d like to describe one of those integrations that we are particularly proud of: the automation of the creation and synchronization of Superset datasets. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaros%C5%82aw-cellary-77a27477\">Jarek Cellary</a> did the work, and we enjoy sharing his novel work that solves a friction point while improving our data discoverability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Problem statement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Superset charts, and dashboards are always nourished by datasets. This means that it is not enough to simply connect Superset to a database: an extra step of creating a corresponding dataset is necessary for its tables (with or without extra data transformations) to be available.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/imagen-2.png?w=792\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3722\" style=\"width:615px;height:auto\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The Superset data flow pyramid: notice the semantic layer with datasets on top of the database (tables)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This extra step probably means little for workers with plenty of knowledge of the world of data, but it is definitely an impediment that can discourage folks in other business units, who may be less familiar with the data realm. And, why not say it, it\u2019s also wonderful to eliminate additional hurdles in our daily work! \ud83d\ude42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, these are some of the handicaps that Superset\u2019s native table-dataset solution presents:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It always requires an extra manual step for the dataset creation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Table updates are also a manual step folks need to be aware of, as changes are not synced.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Datasets generated by multiple users but from the same tables might be redundant or duplicates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Other users\u2019 datasets might present permissions issues.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>As explained in <a href=\"https://data.blog/2023/03/02/the-data-docs-a-wordpress-based-data-discoverability-tool/\">a previous post</a> about our Data Discovery&nbsp;Tool, we are also generating table and columns metadata annotations using the Apache Avro format. We\u2019d like to keep those so Superset users have all the context handy.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal was straightforward: to make all the tables hosted in our database available to our users as if they already had the category of datasets. In this way, the creation of visualizations would be fast, intuitive, and supported by the security of having updated schemas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accordingly, we set out to create a script that took into account the following requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Browse the catalog: it is necessary that we constantly scan all the available tables to detect possible new features and changes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frequency: we believe that daily execution would be ideal.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interaction with Superset, in such a way that the datasets can be rewritten in case of detection of changes in the tables.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mirror our Apache Avro annotations, if possible</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The development that we finally implemented was a Python script that executes queries on the database, such as <code>SHOW SCHEMAS</code> or <code>SHOW TABLES FROM \"{schema}\"</code>, and later compares the response with the existing datasets in Superset. If any change is detected, then the script initiates a communication via API to create a new data set or modify an existing one. Fortunately, Superset supports datasets and column descriptions, so the annotations are covered too. We run this script daily on our Airflow instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/imagen-5.png?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3725\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Example of one of our available synchronized table-dataset. Notice the table description, displayed when hoovering on the information icon</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding satisfaction in utilizing open source solutions is even greater when we can successfully modify and evolve the code further to meet our needs. In so doing, we enrich the software\u2019s development, contributing our grain of sand to the community. For instance, <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25553\">here\u2019s</a> our Data Engineering team lead <a href=\"https://khroliz.com/\">Igor Khrol</a> proposing and implementing a fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope that this post inspires Superset installations in other organizations, along with potential solutions that address this problem in future releases.</p>\n",

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2023/08/30/the-new-face-of-jetpack-stats/",
    "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>History</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/stats/\">Jetpack Stats</a> is one of <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a>\u2019s most popular offerings, providing analytics for over 14 million users on <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> and self-hosted WordPress sites with the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a> plugin. When our journey began, however, it also happened to be one of the most neglected products in our product lineup. Our wp-admin experience showed its age through its Web 2.0 aesthetic, and our WordPress.com interface was experiencing technical issues entangled with the architectural decisions we made over a decade prior. In September 2022, we kicked off a project to give our customers a much-improved experience; it was time to modernize Jetpack Stats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Team&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team comprised six full-stack engineers and two designers from the Jetpack division. We hailed from around the globe: Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Taiwan, and the USA. In addition to our wide geographic spread, the team also brought a diverse range of technical experience: A couple of engineers had only recently graduated from our Developer Apprenticeship. (The program enables non-engineering Automatticians to shift into the engineering career track by apprenticing within an existing engineering team.) I capped off the other extreme for the team, having worked as an engineer for over a decade and six in Automattic. Our designers have also been long-tenured with Automattic; <a href=\"https://designtactician.blog/\">Jeff</a> celebrated his nine-year mark this August, while <a href=\"https://keoshi.com/\">Filipe</a> will reach his eleven-year mark this October.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Engineering with Designers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Iterating technically on a product is inherently fraught with challenges: What&#8217;s the best way to technically scope a product issue? How can we evenly distribute the workload across the team? What&#8217;s the best way to enforce code quality without each of us becoming gatekeepers on pull requests?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process becomes significantly more complicated when you throw design collaboration into the mix. Jeff, Filipe, and I nipped this problem in the bud by tightly integrating the design process with our engineering workflow. Instead of each side working in isolation, our development process directly involved designers during our pull request reviews. Conversely, our design process looped in engineers much earlier, soliciting gut checks and feasibility feedback far before a finished design specification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We communicated extensively through <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">internal blogs</a>, Figma boards, Slack messages, and GitHub issues and pull requests. A neat side effect of all this: It enabled the rest of Automattic to follow our daily work, allowing us to gather feedback from colleagues with whom we would not usually have the chance to collaborate. I might not be writing this article if my colleague from the Data division, who had been closely following our work from afar, hadn&#8217;t prompted me for one!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Chaos, Managed</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As an engineering manager, I primarily focused on maintaining a smooth collaboration between our designers and engineers. I often translated agreed-upon design specifications into well-scoped engineering tasks for the team to hash out on the code base. When such agreements were scarce, I served as the tiebreaker in the name of pragmatism, usually opting for a solution we could quickly realize and iterate upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2516\" height=\"452\" data-attachment-id=\"3669\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2023/08/30/the-new-face-of-jetpack-stats/scr-20230818-iki/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scr-20230818-iki.png?fit=2516%2C452&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2516,452\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"scr-20230818-iki\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scr-20230818-iki.png?fit=300%2C54&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scr-20230818-iki.png?fit=1024%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-id=\"3669\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scr-20230818-iki.png?resize=2516%2C452&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3669\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scr-20230818-iki.png?w=2516&amp;ssl=1 2516w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scr-20230818-iki.png?resize=300%2C54&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scr-20230818-iki.png?resize=1024%2C184&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scr-20230818-iki.png?resize=768%2C138&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scr-20230818-iki.png?resize=1536%2C276&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scr-20230818-iki.png?resize=2048%2C368&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">Weekly Highlights Section</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I reviewed nearly every pull request the team cranked out, providing appropriate technical guidance and fostering a ship-then-iterate mindset among our engineers. When practical, I also unblocked the team by quickly prototyping technically demanding features, such as new API endpoints that required novel aggregation of our analytics data (e.g., our new weekly highlights section).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Our Priorities</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our highest priority is providing accurate and actionable insights for any WordPress site, while respecting visitors\u2019 privacy. At the core of this priority is the ability to provide reliable page view metrics and anonymized unique visitor counts, which we use to surface ancillary insights like website referrers and visitor locations. These are at the heart of everything we do, and are integral to Jetpack Stats\u2019 identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve heard from our customers how important it is to know who is directing traffic to their site so they can better understand their site&#8217;s overall content strategy. We&#8217;ve also heard from customers who have used geographic insight from Jetpack Stats to target specific regions in their marketing campaigns, with great success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Changes</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare resize180\"><div class=\"juxtapose\" data-mode=\"horizontal\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" id=\"3659\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/traffic-bluefore-2.png?resize=3033%2C4674&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"3033\" height=\"4674\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\"/><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" id=\"3660\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/traffic-bluafter-2.png?resize=2804%2C7882&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"2804\" height=\"7882\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\"/></div><figcaption>Jetpack Stats on WordPress.com, Before and After<br>(Drag the slider to compare the two images)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of all the features we created, our new page layout significantly improved the readability of Jetpack Stats. Our previous layout, pictured above, made it challenging for customers to quickly digest the page. Depending on the quantity/quality of your visitors, various sections of the page would grow or shrink in response. Our new grid-based layout carved out predefined areas on the page for these sections, giving each analytics module a dedicated place in our page&#8217;s information architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also added horizontal bar chart backgrounds for most analytics modules. This change makes it easy for users to quickly discern the magnitude of a data point in relation to its peers, making it easy to compare your site&#8217;s popularity between, say, the United States and Canada at a glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare resize150\"><div class=\"juxtapose\" data-mode=\"horizontal\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" id=\"3665\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/wp-admin-before-blurred.png?resize=2154%2C3288&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"2154\" height=\"3288\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\"/><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" id=\"3666\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/wp-admin-after-blurred.png?resize=2552%2C5836&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"2552\" height=\"5836\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\"/></div><figcaption>Jetpack Stats on wp-admin, Before and After<br>(Drag the slider to compare the two images)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the challenges in modernizing the Jetpack Stats interface on wp-admin, we created a lightweight shell of our <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> dashboard to power our new wp-admin analytics dashboard, complete with asynchronous module loading and deployed to a static asset host we control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new Jetpack Stats dashboard on wp-admin, our Jetpack customers can reap the benefits of a modern analytics dashboard like the one WordPress.com customers already enjoy. Every improvement we\u2019d made to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> interface has now found its way into the wp-admin dashboard; our goal is to keep the wp-admin dashboard in lock-step with the WordPress.com dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers will get a lot out of this update, including country analytics, new heat map visualizations, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Present and The Future</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our modernization project, which began in September 2022, successfully launched in March 2023. We closely watched our product usage, solicited customer feedback, and conducted live video interviews with customers to measure our success. We\u2019re happy to report our changes were very well-received!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since modernizing Jetpack Stats in March, we\u2019ve continued to ship iterative improvements, focusing on email subscriber stats, and using community outreach to identify remaining pain points in our product. Other analytics tools may exist today, but we\u2019re proud that Jetpack Stats is an easy, surefire way to get insights specifically tailored to your WordPress site. From your personal photo blog to your company\u2019s primary shopfront, we do our best to make site analytics easy.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Earlier this year, due to soaring interest and multiple product initiatives, we went on a quest to evaluate and deploy an internally hosted <a href=\"https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/\">vector database</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re in the midst of the AI revolution, and many new AI-inspired product initiatives rely on vector embeddings. Embeddings are generated by AI models, and take the form of high dimensional vectors of features that represent the data in a manner that can be <a href=\"https://blog.parse.ly/machine-learning-content-api/\">used to create clusters, find similarity</a>, and perform <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search\">semantic search</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to find similar entities by matching these embedding vectors, we have to be able to store and query them in a scalable and efficient way. Because the vectors are high dimensional, it is not feasible to perform exhaustive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix\">pairwise distance calculations</a> on large datasets to determine similarity; therefore, these need to be calculated using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Approximation_methods\">Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (<a href=\"https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib\">HNSW</a>) and Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/annoy\">ANNOY</a>) are examples of ANN algorithms, with HNSW being graph-based and ANNOY a tree-based approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2040\" height=\"830\" data-attachment-id=\"3625\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2023/08/07/quest-for-efficient-ai-an-evaluation-of-the-vector-database-landscape/image-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?fit=2040%2C830&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2040,830\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?fit=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?fit=1024%2C417&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?resize=2040%2C830&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3625\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?w=2040&amp;ssl=1 2040w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?resize=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?resize=1024%2C417&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?resize=768%2C312&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?resize=1536%2C625&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">HNSW.

Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/annoy\">https://github.com/spotify/annoy</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Vector databases implement <a href=\"https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks#glove-100-angular\">one or more of these algorithms</a>, and there are many candidates in the market to choose from. We see brand new products along with older products adding vector storage and ANN search to their existing capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After an initial investigation, the decision was taken to move ahead with <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-8-0-0\">Elasticsearch 8</a> (ES) as it was already <a href=\"https://data.blog/tag/elasticsearch/\">entrenched in the Automattic stack</a>. Additionally, performing hybrid search would be easily attainable since most, if not all, of the content we wanted to create embeddings for was already being indexed by existing pipelines on ES. However, as soon as we started testing different use cases, we ran into the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/dense-vector.html#dense-vector-params\">vector size limitation</a> on the larger <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model\">OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 embedding vectors</a>, which have an output size of 1536 dimensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/dense-vector.html#dense-vector-params\">According to the ES documentation</a>, you cannot have an indexed vector of size greater than 1024 dimensions. ES does allow you to create a dense vector field with a size of up to 2048 dimensions, but it cannot be indexed. 1024 is fine for most run-of-the-mill use cases, but not for the recommended OpenAI models and so it was actually a blocker for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://elastiknn.com/\">Elastiknn plugin</a> that Tumblr is using in ES 7 also has <a href=\"https://elastiknn.com/api/#elastiknn_dense_float_vector-datatype\">a recommendation in the docs not to exceed ~1000</a>. We weren\u2019t sure if it would actually prevent indexing above that value, as ES 8 does, but it was apparent that the lookup speed was going to be negatively affected. So ES was out of the running as a candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The shortlist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This left us with the following candidates: <a href=\"https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch\">RediSearch</a>, <a href=\"https://milvus.io/\">Milvus</a>, <a href=\"https://vald.vdaas.org/\">Vald</a>, <a href=\"https://www.trychroma.com/\">Chroma</a>, <a href=\"https://qdrant.tech/\">Qdrant</a>, and <a href=\"https://vespa.ai/\">Vespa</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the initial round of fact finding, feature comparison, and experimentation, the list of options has been whittled down. Milvus and Vald were excluded because of their dependency on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\">Kubernetes</a> for manageable deployments. This is because we are deploying the vector database as a shared service internally and we didn\u2019t want to have to deploy a new <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/\">Kubernetes production cluster</a> simply to install a vector database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chroma lacked core scaling and consistency features. Weaviate has a limitation that if you scale the nodes you have to rebuild indexes, as well as the <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/cluster#consistency-and-current-limitations\">other limitations have they listed</a>, such as replication still being under development. These two products are still obviously being developed and these problems will be solved, but for now we\u2019ll pass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RediSearch was originally high on the list, because it has the base core features we need and is also already part of the Automattic stack, with its scalability being well known. It does come with a caveat of its licensing though, so it\u2019s not a clear winner on those merits alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That left us with these three contenders:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch\">RediSearch</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://qdrant.tech/\">Qdrant</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://vespa.ai/\">Vespa</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-regular\"><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><strong>RediSearch</strong></th><th><strong>Qdrant</strong></th><th><strong>Vespa</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Algorithm</td><td>HNSW, FLAT</td><td>HNSW</td><td>HNSW</td></tr><tr><td>Language</td><td>C</td><td>Rust</td><td>Java</td></tr><tr><td>Config</td><td>Well known</td><td><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://qdrant.tech/documentation/distributed_deployment/#raft\">Simple</a></td><td><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/examples/operations/multinode-HA\">Complex</a></td></tr><tr><td>Consistency</td><td>Well known</td><td><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://qdrant.tech/documentation/distributed_deployment/#consistency-guarantees\">Configurable</a>, focused on availability and maximum throughput of search ops.</td><td><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://docs.vespa.ai/en/content/consistency.html\">Configurable</a>, designed for high efficiency under workloads where eventual consistency is an acceptable tradeoff.</td></tr><tr><td>Notable features</td><td>1.

The query syntax is a little unintuitive, but this can be fixed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer\">abstracting it via a library</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qdrant was very simple to get up and running as well, even more so than RediSearch, because it uses the raft consensus protocol, which <em>just works</em>\u2122 , and creating a collection is a single API request, and even simpler with the <a href=\"https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-client\">Python library</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vespa has been in development for a long time and shows this in its configuration and setup requirements. Setting up a cluster wasn\u2019t simple, and neither was getting used to the configuration you have to create for each <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/application-packages-reference.html\">application package</a>, which requires a schema, document, etc. What a finicky experience and sophisticated offering for our simpler needs! \ud83d\ude42 There are many example applications to work off, but I can see this being very <a href=\"https://agilecheetah.com/the-anti-agile-manifesto/\">anti-agile</a> for products/features that only require vector storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Crunch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vespa has by far the richest feature-set. In fact, I ended up getting carried away with prototyping and testing <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/multi-vector-indexing\">multi-vector indexing</a> and <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/custom-embeddings\">custom embeddings</a>\u2014not to mention the hybrid search support with <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-2-the-bm25-algorithm-and-its-variables\">traditional BM25</a>. The major downside is the complexity and somewhat steep learning curve to become productive. I would say that it is a strong contender to be an Elasticsearch replacement, but its rich feature-set and therefore complexity count against it in this comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RediSearch has a dependability and familiarity that puts it in good stead to be a natural choice, however, Qdrant matches its simplicity, is <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/tree/main/datastore/providers\">recognized by industry</a>, and has the biggest standout feature for our use case of a pure vector database, the <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quantization/\">automated quantization</a>. Since vector embeddings are stored in memory, this feature has the potential to have significant impact as we scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Decision</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize, when it comes to selecting between them for scalability, performance, observability, and vector database functionality, the two options we considered the best were RediSearch and Qdrant. Based on our evaluation, the recommendation was to deploy a Qdrant cluster, which is exactly what we did.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Outcome</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We conducted this evaluation so that we could launch an internal service that was performant, easy to deploy, and maintain. So far the Qdrant cluster has only peaked at serving 37 searches per second in production and it has not been necessary to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_or_scale_out\">horizontally scale</a> the service, however we have upgraded it effortlessly a few times without incident with the Qdrant Team releasing new features at a steady release cadence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As our internal service\u2019s usage expands across Automattic, we\u2019ll begin to learn the limits of the cluster and enter into the horizontal scaling phase with certainty that, considering how effortless the administration has been so far, the process should go off without a hitch. Let us know if you\u2019ve had a similar experience or maybe your tests resulted in a different outcome? We\u2019ll be happy to hear about them.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Maintaining a good work-life balance is crucial to ensure that your energy remains high in the long run and you don\u2019t burn out, and it\u2019s a challenge when you join a distributed company. It is always tricky to keep the separation between work and personal time. But it\u2019s even more challenging when you work at home. And the most challenging of all is when you don\u2019t have a specific room that you can call your home office. So don\u2019t discard the coworking option initially; it will help you get used to your new schedule and possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I have good news: distributed environments give you lots of extra tools and the flexibility to find balance. You just need to learn how to use them and then be intentional in how you do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding your new remote environment.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t feel bad about not finding your place and pace immediately. A new distributed environment and likely an async communication model mean chaos. Your onboarding buddies and mentors (or whatever they are called around you) are there to help you get acclimatized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><strong><em>Chaos doesn\u2019t mean a lack of order. </em></strong><em>Chaotic systems are dynamic systems that appear random and disorganized but are actually governed by underlying patterns and deterministic laws. So there is light at the end of the tunnel. \ud83d\ude00</em>&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You need time and a bit of help to understand and harness all these new rules and structures. </strong>You don\u2019t need to work longer hours: that is not sustainable. Instead, focus on being more productive and happier (these two are intimately related). <strong>Starting fresh and fully energized each day is about setting boundaries between your work and private life, feeling included and that you are a part of something, and understanding the impact you contribute.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no one-size-fits-all recipe to speed up the transition. But there are some well-tested tips. (BTW: Don\u2019t hesitate to share yours in the comments below, and you\u2019ll have your day&#8217;s good deed done \u2713).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1.

Notifications are marvelously designed, crafted, and A/B tested\u2026 to capture your attention! And if your attention is on work-related issues, you never unplug! It would be sad if you were paying attention to a work project instead of your loved ones or your hobby during your spare time. Right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using your spare time on work issues doesn\u2019t make you more productive. On the contrary, you\u2019ll very likely just be more tired the following day. Our company wants focused, productive people, not people working 24/7 and making mistakes because they are too tired, unhappy, or burnt out to be creative. Your company is all for work-life balance! If not, <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/\">knock on our door</a>! \ud83d\ude42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a team lead, lead by example. I got the message when my former division lead showed me he did not have Slack on his cell phone. Seriously, did I need it if he did not? Removing distractions makes you more productive and less stressed. But if you are a hardcore Data person and you won\u2019t believe it until you see the data, check out <a href=\"https://www.nirandfar.com/indistractable/\">Indistractable by Nir Eyal</a> for studies, analysis, and some tricks and advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2a. Dramatize the boundaries of your working time: Meditation.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We need clear boundaries to have a good work-life balance. Let\u2019s highlight them clearly to send our brain and body the message that we\u2019re starting or finishing the workday. When you work in an office, your commute time and space serve as a signal that is difficult to ignore, especially when it takes several hours a day. When you work at home, you still need this frontier. But you can replace all that time you waste in a <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-place\">non-place</a> (your car, the underground, walking time, etc.) with something else that <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reify\">reifies</a> this border using less time and energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite boundary markers is <strong>meditation</strong>. It takes just 5 to 10 minutes before starting work and again at the end of the workday. Avoid jumping in and stopping abruptly, which usually means carrying all of your work thoughts and preoccupations into your family or personal time. You can meditate by yourself or using an app. I\u2019d say <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://app.wakingup.com/\">Waking Up</a> is my preferred one, but I\u2019ve used Headspace, Insight Timer, <a href=\"https://elefantezen.com/5-increibles-beneficios-de-reirse-a-carcajadas/\">Elefante Zen</a>, and some others with identically good results. I\u2019m proud and grateful that <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> offers these as <a href=\"https://automattic.com/benefits/\">wellness benefits</a>. But I&#8217;d still pay for it if this were not the case.<a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2b. Dramatize the boundaries of your working time: Other useful micro-actions.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Is meditation not your thing? Fair enough. Many other alternatives require your attention for no more than 3 to 10 minutes and give excellent results. You can compose your own toolbox and use different strategies depending on the day:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Starting the day by showing gratitude</strong> for a couple of things that happened the day before helps set boundaries and makes you realize how fortunate you are. I love the <a href=\"https://happyfeed.co\">HappyFeed</a> app because it is quick and effective, but you can use your journaling app (<a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/\">DayOne</a> cannot be beaten), and in no time, you\u2019ll have a gratitude repository that you can read when you feel you need a nudge in the right direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What about <strong>welcoming your inner creativity and writing a few lines, just for yourself,</strong> to start your day? You could try to be poetic or keep it prosaic, but it doesn\u2019t need a purpose: it\u2019s just for you. Julia Cameron\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way\">book</a>, <em>The Artist\u2019s Way,</em> fully develops this idea and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/style/julia-cameron-the-artists-way.html\">suggests writing a few pages</a> a day, but you could also go with just a few lines of text. (Make it more meaningful using a <a href=\"https://www.paperhigh.com/product-category/journals-photo-albums/journals/elephant-dung-notebooks/\">notebook with soul</a>.) You could even publish/release<a href=\"https://iberiaprofunda.com/tag/micropoema-visual/\"> some of your short</a> texts if you feel like it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1457\" height=\"2048\" data-attachment-id=\"3534\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2023/05/23/tips-for-a-healthy-work-life-balance-for-people-starting-at-a-remote-company/whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12-46-06/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12.46.06.jpeg?fit=1457%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1457,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12.46.06\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12.46.06.jpeg?fit=213%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12.46.06.jpeg?fit=729%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12.46.06.jpeg?resize=1457%2C2048&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3534\" style=\"width:365px;height:512px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12.46.06.jpeg?w=1457&amp;ssl=1 1457w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12.46.06.jpeg?resize=213%2C300&amp;ssl=1 213w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12.46.06.jpeg?resize=729%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 729w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12.46.06.jpeg?resize=768%2C1080&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whatsapp-image-2023-05-06-at-12.46.06.jpeg?resize=1093%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1093w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">My elephant dung notebook was a gift from a good friend</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We frequently utilize coffee to feel awake. We gulp it while reading the first emails / Slack direct messages, etc. However, we can convert our coffee into a magnificent ritual that acts as a boundary marker and a pleasant and meaningful experience. Use a significant <a href=\"https://www.niquisdelparamo.com/producto/taza-surf-mar-de-campos/\">mug with a story</a>, feel the warmth caressing your hands, watch the fleeting nebulous steam, and abandon yourself to the so unique scent. Take a sip and feel the bitter yet amiable punch on your tongue. I grind my coffee beans every morning for my wife and me, and I sometimes imagine the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cafeguarania/videos/un-paseo-de-13-segundos-por-el-cafetal-as%C3%AD-como-guillermo-molinas-escribiera-en-/234517670950705/\">red beans in the tree</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqK0sG1LcMs\">despulpado</a>, or the farmer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hwe6jFwC2Q\">replanting the coffee bush</a>. <strong>If you put aside 3-4 minutes and protect this time for a conscious experience, everything becomes a celebration. Coffee or tea are perfect sparks.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You can devote these 3 minutes to reflect on a word or phrase.</strong> There are tons of motivational quotes (often mistakenly attributed, but this is a different tale) that you can use. I prefer being able to manipulate my objects of meditation, so these<a href=\"https://www.inspiredstillness.com/product/self-mastery-card/\"> self-mastery cards</a> were a good choice in my case. They are deep but not very cheesy, and I like them. Or, you can create your own. Or you can Google a list of words and ask your kids to create cards out of them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You can start a GLAD journal</strong>. Like the gratitude journal, you can reflect on your previous day\u2019s highlights. One thing that made you <strong>G</strong>rateful, one <strong>L</strong>earning, one <strong>A</strong>ccomplishment, and something that <strong>D</strong>elighted you. I write my diary in <a href=\"https://simplenote.com\">Simplenote</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Go for a walk.</strong> What if it\u2019s raining, or you cannot go outside for some reason? Yoga, Stretching, or a dance break are valid alternatives \ud83d\ude42</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Add structure to your workday.&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I keep a remote working routine to guide and add rhythm to my journey. Give it a try! Outline yours without worrying too much about making it perfect the first time: it will be a work in progress. I used the routine in <a href=\"https://remotefrog.com/2020/12/20/a-remote-working-routine-to-be-productive-and-happy-in-4-steps/\">this post</a> a while ago. After that, I used to do the one in the picture shown below.

After that, take a picture with your cellphone to have it always in sight on your computer. You can use it as a screen background or open a window with the image as a part of your \u201cstarting the day\u201d automated workflow (I use <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\">Alfred</a> for this).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>First thing in the morning, I read emails, Slack messages, or any other communication.</strong> It could also be <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/new\">Basecamp</a>, social networks in some cases, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/reader/\">WordPress Reader</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">P2 notifications</a>, or messages from your project management tools. And most days, <strong>I don\u2019t reread my messages until the following day (except for Slack DMs). This creates uninterrupted focus time</strong>, makes me productive, and prevents <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.huffpost.com/entry/email-apnea-screen-apnea-_b_1476554\">email apnea</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>I decide what to do with every message I get. </strong>(Credit to Ari Meisel for the<a href=\"https://foundr.com/email-management-tips\"> inspiration</a>, even if he uses just Delete, Do, and Defer). My options are:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Answer (This would be equivalent to Ari\u2019s Do)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add something to a tasks list (In a Trello card / Asana / Todoist). (This would be = Defer)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delegate it or pass it along. (Do)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do nothing and forget about it immediately. In other words, Acknowledge\u2014or not\u2014and Delete.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>So, <strong>once I\u2019ve finished with the messages, I have a list of tasks.</strong> Some come from the \u201cDefer\u201d action, some from sprint activities or my tasks backlog. At this point, I decide what I will do that day, in which order, and then I stick with my decision.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>I start the prioritized tasks without the uncomfortable feeling of having \u201cthings floating around that I should take care of\u201d</strong>. I\u2019ve already decided what to do, and if something is not on the list, it is not as high a priority as those tasks on the list. And therefore, I can ignore it, at least until the following day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The key point is that I devote time to digest information (reading notifications) and reflect (setting priorities) before starting things. I\u2019m convinced that, too often, we <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/03/31/in-defense-of-thinking/\">neglect </a>reflection because we overvalue the importance of the time directly devoted to producing tangible outcomes. But when you think first, you can do things right and keep the flow that makes you productive and happy. You can use a tool like <a href=\"https://fullfocus.co/planner/\">Full Focus Planner</a>. But don\u2019t allow the coolness to make you lose sight of the purpose: focusing on impactful work and not just staying busy. This planner incorporates space for you to define \u201crituals\u201d\u2014repeated actions that mark the start and end of your day/workday to help you transition from personal time to work time. Ring a bell?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Connect with your body.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we work with knowledge, we tend to fixate on tricks, routines, tips, and habits to make our brain perform better. At 110% if possible. In so doing, we risk forgetting our body, where the brain sits. Be intentionally self-empathetic, self-compassionate, and kind to yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first and foremost life hack I could share is so simple: <strong>Sleep</strong>. You can use one of the myriad of apps out there to improve your sleep. (My recommendation would be <a href=\"https://www.sleepcycle.com/\">Sleep Cycle</a> to set alarms to ring when they don\u2019t interrupt a sleep cycle).&nbsp;Or you can follow a method like <a href=\"https://www.thesleepreset.com/\">Sleep Reset</a>. But there is no magic recipe. The best path to better sleep is to sleep more. Convince yourself to devote time to sleep, and you\u2019ll have 90% of the work done. When in need, a short nap has the power to fix the day downstream. \ud83d\ude42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second life hack is also a truism. Sorry if you expected something more sophisticated. <strong>Enjoy</strong>! I couldn\u2019t be more mindful and explanatory than Dan Walmsley in a recent internal (to Automattic) post:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><em>I have to have things that I\u2019m passionate about, regardless of whether they\u2019re related to work. And that makes my work better because work means more when life is worth living. You\u2019re not just working to kind of make it to the next day. You\u2019re working because you have a life you enjoy, and work is part of it.</em></p><cite>Dan Walmsley</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sleep, enjoy, and\u2026 take care of yourself</strong>. And yourself is not just your brain, but also, and especially, your body. We must thank our bodies for being there and allowing us to think. If we connect inwards (with our body), we can feel grounded and fueled and be sustainably productive. So check continuously or at least several times a day:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Take ergonomics seriously</strong>: you need a good chair, table, keyboard, mouse, screen, light, etc. And don\u2019t discard a virtual ergonomics evaluation!&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you feel energized, <strong>refuel before it\u2019s too late</strong>. If you deplete your energy, your productive day will be over. There is no way back.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hydrate</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Breathe. <strong>Soften your muscles from time to time.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Look away from the screen</strong> at least every half an hour. (I love <a href=\"http://eyecare.apps4u.net/\">this browser plugin</a> to get reminders to ease eye strain.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Say to yourself, \u201cYou\u2019re doing great\u201d from time to time. And <strong>celebrate your success \ud83d\ude42</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep.

(At Automattic, we have tons of these channels\u2014from #poetry to #women, #bluffers, or #sustainability, and blogs ranging from babies, pets, Brazilians to hot dogs or beards\u2026 just to mention a few.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check out your company\u2019s Employee Resource Groups. At Automattic, we have resource groups around topics such as Neurodiversity, Queerness, Sustainability, and Physical Disability.

Don\u2019t forget to say good morning when you start working, create casual conversation, and add your touch of charm! You\u2019re probably worried about what your teammates might think of you. But they are likely eager to meet their new team member.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is there someone around you\u2019d like to know better, or do you think that you could learn something from or with? Do you share a hobby, or did you leave a similar comment on a post?

Don\u2019t feel ashamed if your brain melts after reading, writing, and speaking English for 8 hours. It\u2019s helpful to meet and <strong>talk with people from your country/region and in your native language</strong>. Even short conversations or comments make a difference and could help you deal with new job stress. In no time, you\u2019ll have written 14 million words in English.

And the very first part of the creed is \u201c<a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/never-stop-learning/\">I will never stop learning</a>\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>The first and most important line of the creed means that you\u2019re never finished. There is always </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rules-live-infinite-learners-reid-hoffman/\"><em>more to learn</em></a><em>. Your list of unread books is always going to be longer than the </em><a href=\"https://automattic.com/library/\"><em>ones you\u2019ve read</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Data division, we\u2019ve taken that advice literally, and created a monthly data book club. It\u2019s lots of fun, so we thought we\u2019d share how we organize ours so that you can do the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2889\" height=\"2889\" data-attachment-id=\"3522\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2023/04/19/how-to-organize-a-data-book-club-at-work/img_2657/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?fit=2889%2C2889&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2889,2889\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 13 Pro&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1681825433&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.7&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"img_2657\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?resize=2889%2C2889&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3522\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?w=2889&amp;ssl=1 2889w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_2657.jpeg?resize=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How-To Guide</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Choose Some Books</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To start off, we looked at some of the recommended reading lists posted on the web. Many data <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/articles/data-analytics-books-for-beginners\">learning</a> <a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/data-science-books.html\">programs</a> <a href=\"https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-books/\">provide</a> <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/blog/the-22-best-data-science-books-to-read-in-2022\">one</a>, and <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/\">Towards Data Science</a> regularly posts book recommendations. We also subscribe to a few data newsletters that include book recommendations.The <a href=\"https://www.davidrgreen.com/newsletter\">one from David Green</a> is excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We put the best books in a spreadsheet and invited anyone in our division to add their recommendations. Our list currently has 39 suggestions in it \u2013 probably more than any of us could read in a year!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We let people sign up for the books they like, so we generally choose the books that attract the most interest. But we also mix it up a little: for example, we would avoid reading two books in a row on, say, data visualization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do have a few guidelines.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The books should be available in a digital version. We are a distributed workforce and online deliveries can take weeks to arrive in some parts of the world. We look for books that you can receive and read in a single month.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whenever possible, we choose books that offer an audio version. We want to make sure the books are accessible to our colleagues with different learning styles and with disabilities.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The price of the books should be reasonable. Sometimes we splurge a bit for a particular title, but most of the books cost under $40 USD each.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The books should be related to data, but here we are also pretty flexible. We have read books about data visualization, of course, but also ones on productivity.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Find Readers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though our book club is focused on data-related books, it is open to the whole company. This means that we include people doing data-related work both in and outside of the data division, those who are considering switching roles to join the division, and folks who are simply interested in the book or topic. We advertise our meetings in our own team and division Slack channels, but also in company-wide channels. This is a 100% optional activity, so participation varies month-by-month. The biggest factor in determining participation is the book title.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Joining this book club and having discussions among peers\u2026 This is the first time I\u2019ve managed to finish reading a book in years. </em></p>\n<cite><em>&#8211; Jie Bao</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Pick A Schedule and Organize Some Discussions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We read one book a month and discuss it only once. We find this usually works better than scheduling multiple discussions for a single title. When the meetings take place depends on who signs up. Even when people have lots to discuss, it can be hard to find times to meet. We\u2019re busy!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we are distributed, our meetings are always video conference calls. This lets people join in from all over the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a distributed company, we also document our meetings and post the discussion notes internally. This empowers people to contribute asynchronously. This keeps learning accessible to the whole team. It also means that we have a record of our book reviews. That makes it easier for others to decide if a book is worth reading later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Our Reading List</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are a few of the books we\u2019ve read so far and have found especially interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Delivering Data Analytics: A Step-By-Step Guide to Driving Adoption of Business Intelligence from Planning to Launch</em> by Nicholas Kelly (2021).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness</em> by Chade-Meng Tan (2014).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals</em> by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (2015).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Dialogue: The Art Of Thinking Together</em> by William Isaacs and Peter M. Senge (1999).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Excellence in People Analytics: How to Use Workforce Data to Create Business Value</em> by David Green and Jonathan Ferrar (2021).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And here are a few titles we hope to tackle soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Bayesian Data Analysis</em> by Andrew Gelman, Aki Vehtari, John Carlin, Hal S. Stern, David Dunson, Donald Rubin (1995).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Software Engineering at Google</em> by Titus Winters, Tom Manshreck, Hyrum Wright (2020).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people by Aditya Y. Bhargava (2015).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For more reading suggestions, check out our <a href=\"https://data.blog/what-we-are-reading/\">list here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give it a try! We\u2019ve found our book club to be a rewarding, inclusive way to incorporate team learning into our work lives. We hope you will too!</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p><em>Welcome to Women of Datamattic\u2014conversations with some of the remarkable women working all over the world to build, maintain, and explore Automattic\u2019s data landscape and make the web a better place. Today\u2019s interviewee is</em> <strong><em>t</em></strong><em>he Code Wrangler, Menaka Sankaralingam.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who are you and what do you do?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a Code Wrangler in the WooCommerce Data team at Automattic. We focus on helping various teams in the WooCommerce Division make data informed decisions. I work on a range of things: (1) data ingestion from various data sources like Stripe or the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/\">WooCommerce Marketplace</a>, (2) data transformations via code in Scala and SQL, (3) reporting on Looker dashboards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally from India, I currently live in Dubai with my spouse, two children, and my mother. I love to read good humor, and am always searching for it. If you have recommendations, please pass them on. I like realistic fiction, but don\u2019t enjoy science fiction. I also enjoy children\u2019s literature which makes me think I am a child at heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What inspired you to become an engineer?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not an engineer by degree, but by role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, I chose Computer Science to avoid Biology (as those were the only two options). Back then, society\u2019s dictates were such that choosing Biology implied that I had to work towards the medical profession, and I was not keen on that path. That was the first step that led me towards engineering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoyed programming (in BASIC \ud83d\ude00) in high school and that love of programming still continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I have to say that I never consciously chose engineering, but always chose to do things that interested me\u2026. Most of the other things that I tried, I failed. So, it was engineering that chose me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s your day-to-day like and which tools do you use?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My day starts around 5:30 am with cooking. Around 7:30 am, once I\u2019m done sending the children out, I spend an hour learning. Around 9:00 am, I start my work. Though the first half of my day is very structured, I have a loose schedule towards the evening to accommodate meetings with my co-workers in other time zones. In the evening, I go for a Yoga session or a walk in the nearby park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vim is my favorite editor and I used the command line utilities a lot. In my daily work, I use these two extensively, as well as Looker, SQL, and a wide range of other technologies on an as-needed basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I\u2019ve been working with Amazon RedShift and Meltano for Stripe data ingestion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does Automattic support you both in work-place and making sure you have a good life-work balance?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic has transformed my life in many ways.&nbsp;In the workplace, I have the freedom to work on things that I enjoy. I work on a range of tools and technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic supports my personal and professional development. I\u2019ve signed up for courses to learn a new technology or even a new skill like video presentations. (I did <a href=\"https://betteron.com/\">the BetterOn video training</a> last year, which I thoroughly enjoyed.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the remote nature of my work, I can juggle my family responsibilities, personal time, and work without compromising much on any of them. Before I started working remotely, when my daughter was at school, I had to keep her waiting at the daycare until I finished my work. Today, I take a break in the evening to spend time with my son when he returns home and resume work when he goes out to play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, it was thanks to the distributed nature of my work that I could relocate to Dubai a couple of years back.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4032\" height=\"2268\" data-attachment-id=\"3509\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2023/03/22/women-of-datamattic-menaka-sankaralingam/img_2980/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?fit=4032%2C2268&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4032,2268\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"img_2980\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?resize=4032%2C2268&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3509\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?w=4032&amp;ssl=1 4032w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_2980.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Menaka presenting at the recent WooCommerce Division meetup</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>That\u2019s it for today\u2019s edition of Women of Datamattic!

Who are you and what do you do?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a data engineer with the <a href=\"http://openverse.org\">Openverse</a> team at Automattic. Openverse is a search engine for openly licensed media. We are part of the DotOrg division, which focuses on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">the open source WordPress ecosystem</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my role, I primarily help manage the aggregation and indexing we perform of Creative Commons-licensed works from across the web. This involves managing databases, Airflow, Elasticsearch, our API, and many other aspects of our infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What made you want to join Automattic, and how\u2019s your Automattic journey been so far?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was actually another trans person at Automattic who recommended me for the role! I wasn\u2019t even looking for a new position, but a friend of mine (working at A8C at the time) posted the list of open positions at A8C in a group chat we were both a part of. I glanced over the roles and saw a <em>Data Engineering</em> position that was available. I\u2019m a huge proponent of open source; I maintain a number of projects and make contributions to other projects frequently. This particular role was primarily focused on the data aspects of the open source project <a href=\"http://openverse.org\">Openverse</a>, which was right up my alley! After an intense but fruitful trial, I was offered the position on the team. I went from being the only open trans person at my last company to not even being the only trans person <em>on my team</em> at Automattic; that was an incredible shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My time at Automattic has been stellar\u2014I\u2019ve had the opportunity to interact with many wonderful folks, and to grow in areas I wasn\u2019t expecting. Openverse has been a tremendous learning experience for me on the infrastructure side. I\u2019ve appreciated our team\u2019s emphasis on ensuring that the community can get involved, participate in discussions, and help shape the project. A number of contributors from the community have provided significant contributions and improvements! Being able to do all our work in the open has been a huge asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been difficulties along the way too: as a trans person in a country that is becoming <a href=\"https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/second-period-anti-trans-legislative\">increasingly hostile to my existence</a>, it can be hard to focus on productivity and impact as I and my trans siblings fight against genocide. Automattic provides me the space I need when the going gets tough, and the solidarity and community I\u2019ve been able to find in other trans Automatticians has been a bastion against this rising animosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can you tell me more about your day-to-day in Data?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a member of a small team operating a large search engine, we\u2019re all required to wear a number of different hats! My day ranges across checking on our infrastructure, helping with deployments, improving the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/openverse-catalog\">Airflow-based ingestion system</a> we have for gathering CC-licensed works from across the web, troubleshooting database operations, engaging with the community, <a href=\"https://2023.pycascades.com/\">conference organizing</a>, helping to lead our queer employee resource group\u2026it\u2019s quite a gamut!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the primary tasks of my role is managing the over 700 million CC-licensed works that Openverse has indexed. This is no small effort, as we need to refresh this data regularly to capture both new works and updates from our providers. Among other goals, one of our team\u2019s guiding objectives this year is to improve the moderation and content safety aspects of our project. This effort has wide-reaching implications, many of which sit at the core of our data models. As much as we\u2019d like to \u201cmove fast and break things,\u201d the sheer data volume we have requires that we take careful, measured steps towards any changes. It\u2019s an intriguing and challenging set of constraints!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And what about Queeromattic? I\u2019m not sure too many readers of our blog are aware of diversity at A8C and how thriving it is!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Queeromattic is the 2SLGBTQIA+ employee resource group within Automattic. It\u2019s a place for queer folks and allies alike to gather, build community, share difficulties, and put internal resources towards improvements for diverse folks within the company. Queeromattic has played a huge role for me in both joining Automattic and the community I\u2019ve found within the company. When working at a globally distributed, fully remote company, it can be easy to feel disconnected and isolated. Queeromattic is an excellent way to remain connected to other queer folks. That\u2019s part of why I became one of the leads: I wanted to give back to the group that welcomed me and made me feel at home. Queeromattic has also made our meetups quite special, since I know I\u2019ll have the opportunity to be in great company when attending one!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3632\" height=\"3560\" data-attachment-id=\"3498\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2023/03/15/women-of-datamattic-madison-swain-bowden/madison_data_meetup/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?fit=3632%2C3560&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3632,3560\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Paul Chelarescu&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"madison_data_meetup\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?fit=300%2C294&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?fit=1024%2C1004&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?resize=3632%2C3560&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3498\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?w=3632&amp;ssl=1 3632w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?resize=300%2C294&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?resize=1024%2C1004&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?resize=768%2C753&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?resize=1536%2C1506&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?resize=2048%2C2007&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/madison_data_meetup.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.blog/2022/12/16/automattics-first-data-meetup/\">Automattic\u2019s First Data+&nbsp;Meetup</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>That\u2019s it for today\u2019s edition of Women of Datamattic!

    "content": "\n<p><em>Welcome to Women of Datamattic\u2014conversations with some of the remarkable women working all over the world to build, maintain, and explore Automattic&#8217;s data landscape and make the web a better place. Today\u2019s interviewee is our Head of Data, Anna Elek.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who are you, and what do you do?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I lead the central Data function at Automattic (A8C). We work on data infrastructure and tooling, from clusters and tracking systems, through the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://data.blog/2021/04/14/architecting-explat-automattics-new-experimentation-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">experimentation platform&nbsp;</a>&amp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://data.blog/2019/01/08/building-thousands-of-reproducible-ml-models-with-pipe-the-automattic-machine-learning-pipeline/\" target=\"_blank\">ML pipeline</a>&nbsp;all the way to data governance &amp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://data.blog/2023/03/02/the-data-docs-a-wordpress-based-data-discoverability-tool/\" target=\"_blank\">discoverability</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic has a mostly federated data organization: a big part of my job is also to ensure embedded data teams across the business have the information, support and tools they need to succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your career seems quite interesting, spanning various roles and areas. Has data always been your passion?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got into data before I knew it was a \u201creal job\u201d, as I was studying for a Ph.D. in economics with a focus on empirical econometrics (applied statistics for economics): a colleague got hired by a fashion company as a <em>data scientist</em> to predict clothing sizes in an online store, and none of us really believed this was actually a thing one could do for work. But it was!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the path to realizing this was the career path for me was not a straight line. I worked in consultancy &amp; politics after my Master\u2019s, then went back to school to start that Ph.D. for a change of scenery and avoid burnout. I left the program after three years to start a freelance business, primarily focusing on content localization &amp; social media; not data. After a few years and an increasing desire for stability, I started working in a similarly content-focused role at an online travel company. I ended up doing a lot of reporting and analytics work \u201con the side\u201d in that job, picked up some additional tech skills, and eventually transitioned into a full-time analytics position in the same organization &#8211; about 4 years after I left academia. For most of my working life prior, I\u2019d considered myself a communicator &amp; strategist who happened to be rather analytical. As it turns out, I\u2019m an analyst with a knack for communication and strategy. \ud83d\ude09</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You started at Automattic in 2019 as a Senior Data Analyst and became the Head of Data within two years! Can you tell us more about your path and experiences along the way?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience prior to Automattic included a lot of project management, coordination, and communication, quite a bit of it async and distributed. When the opportunity arose during my first 6 months at A8C to take over the leadership of a major data modeling &amp; ETL project, I was very excited to take it on! The project lasted about half a year and was a chance to explore how to coordinate and plan efficiently in our environment. Given it was a rather high stakes, broad-impact project to build out topline metrics for one of our largest business units, it also gave me a lot of additional insight into stakeholder perspectives and unmet needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My then team (central analytics engineering) was left without a lead soon after that project ended, and I stepped into the role, excited to see how I could use the learnings I\u2019d gained to increase the team\u2019s impact and help us scale &amp; evolve together with the business. We grew the team, improved communication and processes, and worked to integrate more closely with our stakeholders and peer teams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a wide, federated organization like Automattic, one of the keys to success for a team is understanding the broader landscape and avenues for efficient prioritization &amp; collaboration. Leading a central team gave me a lot to think about when it came to our organizational model for Data overall: what the best choices for our business would be, where to centralize and where to encourage a federated approach, and how to keep communication aligned. When I eventually moved into my current role, I knew my North Star would be to improve this model intentionally: to create an integrated organization where each central and embedded team, analyst, and engineer has both a clear mandate and strong support &#8211; a data org capable of scaling with Automattic efficiently and impactfully.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There are many women engineers I connect with during my recruiting hours and I\u2019ve been asked frequently: Is a degree a must to get hired in A8C?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely not. A degree is a proxy, an indicator of familiarity with &amp; commitment to a craft. It can be a relevant signal, but there are other equally valid ways to send the same message: a portfolio, work experience, volunteering, passion projects, etc. One of the best software engineers I know has no degree. He was shipping code and building products at the age when school would\u2019ve been on the schedule, and he just never stopped.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"3470\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2023/03/02/the-data-docs-a-wordpress-based-data-discoverability-tool/data_docs_collapsed_looker_explore_page/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/data_docs_collapsed_looker_explore_page.jpg?fit=1600%2C849&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,849\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"data_docs_collapsed_looker_explore_page\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/data_docs_collapsed_looker_explore_page.jpg?fit=300%2C159&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/data_docs_collapsed_looker_explore_page.jpg?fit=1024%2C543&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gptempdownload.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3470\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">One of Anna&#8217;s hobbies is paddle boarding </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>That&#8217;s it for this edition of Women of Datamattic!

    "content": "\n<p>As an organization that relies on data in their operations, Automattic needed a good way to make its data catalog searchable and accessible to anyone in the company. At first, we considered using external, already-available tools, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/ept/avrodoc\">Avrodoc</a> (which we actually implemented) or <a href=\"https://www.amundsen.io/\">Amundsen</a>. While this might have reduced development time, we also saw a couple of important drawbacks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>I can\u2019t find the tables using the internal search! \u2013 </em>While almost all documentation in Automattic is searchable (including the one in GitHub), data handled or stored in a new interface would not be easily covered by our internal search engine.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Wait, another tool? \u2013 </em>Asking everyone to start using yet another interface poses a risk to adoption. No one likes to switch between dozens of interfaces and login multiple times every day.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>This is cool! But what about this other data source we use?</em> \u2013 In Automattic we consume data from multiple sources. Some datasets are defined in a standardized way (like the table schemas in our Hadoop cluster), but others are less conventional and not available for implementation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Great tool! But look, I\u2019d change this and that\u2026 \u2013 </em>External software is difficult (or impossible) to modify and adapt to the specific needs of our users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Our own solution!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that we are a company built on open source software, we wondered, what if we transform the software we are all used to (WordPress!) into our definitive Data Discoverability solution?<br><br>We already had the necessary ingredients for this magic recipe:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/\">WordPress REST API</a> \u2013 Everybody in Automattic uses <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">P2</a>, a WP-based internal communication tool. By automatically publishing pages to it, we can make information available in an environment that&#8217;s already part of everyone&#8217;s workflows. We can do so by providing the content and format with HTML and CSS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Our <a href=\"https://hadoop.apache.org/\">Apache Hadoop</a> cluster \u2013 Where we define and process most of our data (see Data Sources).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/\">TeamCity</a> \u2013 Our on-premises TeamCity installation can execute Python scripts in a scheduled way, and also let us execute them in test environments prior to production.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/get-started\">GitHub</a> \u2013 So we can have versioned files of our dataset schemas and elements, constantly updated and available for crawling and reading.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, the recurrent interactions of these four elements make it possible to publish our target metadata. We have dedicated Python scripts that TeamCity executes on a daily basis. They crawl and inspect files in our cluster, versioned and updated via GitHub, and then extract the information we need and publish it in a friendly format to WordPress-based P2 pages that are accessible and searchable by our main internal tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"731\" height=\"557\" data-attachment-id=\"3490\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2023/03/02/the-data-docs-a-wordpress-based-data-discoverability-tool/imagen/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imagen.png?fit=731%2C557&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"731,557\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"imagen\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imagen.png?fit=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imagen.png?fit=731%2C557&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imagen.png?resize=731%2C557&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Data Docs flow diagram\" class=\"wp-image-3490\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imagen.png?w=731&amp;ssl=1 731w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imagen.png?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Process flow diagram, featuring our current two sources: Hive tables and Looker.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Data Sources</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this moment we work with two related but different data sources. It\u2019s not the purpose of this post to fully describe them, but I believe it\u2019s relevant to explain a bit how they could be integrated in our data docs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hive tables</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have our own internal tool for transforming data, named SQLT. As many other ETL processes, it requires certain definition documents to produce tables: the schemas. The table schemas not only contain the table and fields\u2019 metadata, but also annotations in the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26161_02/html/GettingStartedGuide/avroschemas.html\">Apache Avro schema convention</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/data_docs_table_page.jpg?resize=642%2C320&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3458\" width=\"642\" height=\"320\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Data Docs page of our Hive table <em>a8c.languages</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looker</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.looker.com/\">Looker</a> is our main data visualization tool; we have a self-hosted installation. In addition to charts and dashboards, it transforms and generates its own data (usually from the Hadoop tables). Quoting the Looker documentation:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Looker<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/lookml-terms-and-concepts?authuser=1#lookml_project\"> </a>project is a collection of<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/what-is-lookml?authuser=1\"> LookML</a> files that tell Looker how to connect to your database, how to query your data, and how to control the user interface\u2019s behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our users and developers are interested in having accessible information on Looker\u2019s containers and hierarchies (models, views, explores\u2026) and fields (dimensions, measures\u2026). Fortunately, Looker offers API access, and its project files are also versioned via GitHub.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WP page hierarchy we\u2019ve enabled for this page is: <strong>Project/Repository</strong> &gt; <strong>Model</strong> &gt; <strong>Explore</strong>. Here\u2019s an example of how it looks:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/data_docs_expanded_looker_explore_page.jpg?resize=600%2C231&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3459\" width=\"600\" height=\"231\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Looker explore and Dimensions fields metadata display.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"3460\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2022/12/22/stocking-stuffers-for-the-data-team/2148popup_us/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2148popup_us.jpeg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2148popup_us\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2148popup_us.jpeg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2148popup_us.jpeg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/data_docs_collapsed_looker_explore_page.jpg?resize=600%2C318&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3460\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">We use the \u201csecrets\u201d WP block to expand/collapse the main sections we identified as useful for our users.

With this <a href=\"https://data.blog/2022/12/16/automattics-first-data-meetup/\">cross-data team collaboration</a>, we have leveraged a tool that we&#8217;re already using and investing in as a company to make our data more discoverable internally, with everything available in one single place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How are you meeting <em>your</em> data discoverability needs? Are you using any existing tool, or did you build your own solution? We\u2019d like to hear about your experiences!</p>\n",

How do you foster unity between data-focused employees spread across a central division, various sub-teams, and even individual team members wholly isolated from other data folks within your organization? For the head of Automattic\u2019s central Data division, Anna Elek, the answer was in line with an historic <a href=\"https://distributed.blog/2019/11/26/episode-15-inside-the-grand-meetup/\">foundational practice for Automattic</a>: hold a meetup and empower the attendees to self-organize!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September of this year, Automattic hosted its first company-wide Data+ Meetup. Anna and the event folks at Automattic poured countless hours over several months into the planning and orchestration of this inaugural meetup. We met in Madrid, Spain, and held our sessions within the business center of the <a href=\"https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/madespy-canopy-madrid-castellana/\">Canopy by Hilton at Madrid Castellana</a>. This was a gathering of many &#8220;datums&#8221; (data workers) across the various teams and divisions within Automattic; there were folks present from WooCommerce, DotCom (WordPress.com), HappOps (support operations), Parse.ly, Tumblr, Jetpack, ExPlat (the experimentation team), pipe (the machine learning&nbsp; team), Structure (the DataOps team), and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The week was divided into 3 primary parts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open Space (2 days)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Presentations &amp; Workshops (2 days)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Activity Day (1 day)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Open Space</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After an initial kick-off session on Tuesday, Kirsten (one of the facilitators), orchestrated the <a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/open-space/\">Open Space</a>. These two days intentionally had <em>no agenda</em>, so we spent the first 20 minutes or so after the kick-off coming forward with topics we wanted to discuss. The only rule for proposing a topic was that whoever did so had to be present to lead that discussion. Folks could then choose which sessions they wanted to attend. We were also encouraged to float between running sessions if we didn&#8217;t feel that we were receiving or adding value to a conversation. \u200b</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a fantastic opportunity for members of disparate teams and divisions to come together over common questions, pain points, and goals. Attendees self-organized discussions about career paths, <a href=\"https://data.blog/2022/11/21/how-to-profit-from-an-analytics-skill-matrix/\">skills matrices</a> within the company, communication across Automattic, positive externalities, satellite data teams, causal impact, specific tooling/software, and much more. I had the opportunity to lead two user-group open spaces: one on <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\">Elasticsearch</a> and another on <a href=\"https://airflow.apache.org/\">Airflow</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these user-group discussions were informative for me. Within Automattic, I am a sponsored maintainer of the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/openverse\">Openverse project</a>, a search engine for openly licensed media. Due to the nature of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/openverse/\">Openverse</a>, everyone on our team interacts with data in one way or another. One of my primary goals for the meetup was to connect with folks within Automattic who use tools similar to those used in Openverse, namely Elasticsearch and Airflow. The Open Space provided a mechanism for me to connect with those peers, as in a more structured way than I could have achieved if the entire meetup schedule was set before we arrived. Instead of going around asking every one of the other 60 attendees &#8220;Do you know anything about Elasticsearch?&#8221;, folks were able to opt into an ad-hoc discussion about the tool. While many of those who gathered for the session had some experience with Elasticsearch., There were others like me who had minimal experience and who therefore came to absorb knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were given almost no structure for the gathering, so I took the time to enumerate which teams were represented by the members present and talk about our Elasticsearch setups. I shared difficulties we were encountering with Openverse&#8217;s &#8220;related items&#8221; search algorithm, and folks from the Tumblr division shared how they had optimized their algorithm using <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-deploy-nlp-text-embeddings-and-vector-search\">embeddings and vector searches</a>. We discussed other potential improvements, and I came away from the gathering with some ideas for refinement of our own algorithms. Before we separated, we talked about which communication channels within the company we could share Elasticsearch-specific needs and questions. Even though we were in different divisions working on entirely different projects, we had more in common than we initially thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I structured the Airflow gathering in a similar manner \u2013 enumerating the teams, sharing setups, and formalizing where discussions could happen after the meetup. Both of these gatherings were crucial for an independent team like Openverse. In a team operating outside of a central data division, it can be difficult to know whom to talk to, or where to ask questions. The meetup provided a space to put faces to names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other Open Space gatherings, the data folks were organizing this information at a larger scale. One of the major accomplishments of the meetup was a Data+ Index: a landing page for information on the data division, sub-teams, and individual data projects. This living index serves as a central point of reference for where data is happening within our organization. Across this organizational archipelago, we were able to build bridges of common ground; there was more that connected us than we suspected!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Flash talks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another core feature of Automattic meetups is <a href=\"https://kraft.blog/2014/01/flash-talks/\">flash talks</a>. A flash talk is a short talk (usually less than four minutes) which can be about anything the speaker wants. While the flask talk I gave was an intro to Openverse, we heard talks about back health (from Lucila Stancato), Guatemala (from Raul Arevalo), tricks for beating jet lag (from Dave Machado, exceptionally useful since I flew over 12 hours), the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching\">Yi Jing</a> (from @firatgelbal) and even a tambourine lesson (from @robfelty). The flash talks gave us a beautiful slice-of-life of the data folks. In addition to knowing who to ask about Elasticsearch quirks, I <em>also</em> now know who to ask for back stretching tips!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Fishbowl</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We ended our formal time together with a fishbowl coordinated, once again, by our facilitator, Kirsten. The format of the session is a bit hard to describe: five chairs were placed in the middle of the room, and four people occupied as many chairs. Any time someone from the room wanted to speak, they would come forward and occupy a chair. This was a signal to the others within the circle that one person had to get up and return to their seat. This meant that at any given time there was always one chair unoccupied, a signifier for the room that anyone was welcome to come in and offer their perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This session was <em>exceptionally cool</em> and fascinating to observe! The initial topic was interconnections of data at Automattic, and several of the team leads were brought up to kick off the discussion. Many, many topics were discussed, and conversation meandered across concepts, divisions, ideas, plans, and datasets. This also spawned some discussions about potential collaborations between Openverse and Tumblr \u2013 an exciting prospect on both ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Beyond the sessions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bThe meetup was so much more than the sum of its sessions. Every night we organized small, randomized dinner groups which went out to various local restaurants. This was yet another great chance for cross-pollinating and mingling, on top of being able to enjoy the local flavor! One of my favorite meals was at <a href=\"https://www.azoteadelcirculo.com/\">Azotea del C\u00edrculo</a>. We spent the evening on a rooftop at the heart of the city, surrounded by gorgeous views and wonderful conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default

folks love, it&#8217;s data! And the data we received by way of feedback from the attendees showed that this meetup was a resounding success. Attendees said they felt a stronger sense of connectedness with their other colleagues and with Automattic in general. A large majority of attendees noted that they had an amazing time. Every attendee surveyed said they came away from the event with a better understanding of various aspects of Data at Automattic, and almost every attendee reported that they had held meaningful conversations or discussions with their colleagues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the first large meetup I attended since joining Automattic, and it&#8217;s clear to me why the company values them so much! It was certainly one of the top highlights of my first year at Automattic. I\u2019m thankful to Anna Elek and the other event organizers. This incredible experience would not have been possible without their hard work. Finally, thanks to Automattic for encouraging genuine connections amongst colleagues, supporting our shared learning, and providing memorable and fun experiences to its employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If working at Automattic sounds like it might be for you, <a href=\"https://automattic.com/how-we-work/\">find out more about it</a> by visiting our company website.</p>\n",

I did it because I have four kids.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways I\u2019ve found to have a good work-life balance is to start the day early \u2013 really early. <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/\">Automattic has no set hours</a> or expectation that you\u2019re online from 9 to 5. So when I first started here, I decided to start my day at 6 am, before the kids got up. That way, I could finish work early and be with them when they got home from school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But getting up at 6 am has some downsides, and I needed something besides large amounts of caffeine to get my day started. That something was automation!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently decided to update and revamp my workflow automation, and document it here in case others find it useful.<br><br>Please share your own automation hacks in the comments! I\u2019d love to hear what you are doing to make your work easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Part I: Alfred</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\">Alfred for Mac</a> is a great tool to help automate your day. It lets you use hotkeys, keywords, and text expansion to improve your productivity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But where it really shines is in terms of automation. Alfred Powerpack (a paid upgrade) includes <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/\">Workflows</a>. Workflows let you automate repetitive tasks, and link them together in unique ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2212\" height=\"902\" data-attachment-id=\"3397\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2022/12/12/how-to-save-time-with-alfred-stream-deck-and-apple-shortcuts/alred-site402x/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alred-site402x.png?fit=2212%2C902&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2212,902\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"alred-site402x\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alred-site402x.png?fit=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alred-site402x.png?fit=1024%2C418&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alred-site402x.png?resize=2212%2C902&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alred-site402x.png?w=2212&amp;ssl=1 2212w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alred-site402x.png?resize=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alred-site402x.png?resize=1024%2C418&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alred-site402x.png?resize=768%2C313&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alred-site402x.png?resize=1536%2C626&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alred-site402x.png?resize=2048%2C835&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Screenshot from the </em><a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\"><em>Alfred website</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At Automattic, a number of teams use shared Alfred workflows to automate their tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start-of-Day Workflow</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My most-used workflow is a personal one \u2013 my start-of-day workflow.

At the end it sends me a \u201chello!\u201d notification on my computer, then a second notification in Slack via an incoming webhook. All of this happens while I make coffee.

I also get my project management tools in the browser. This is currently a <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards\">GitHub project board</a>, but it could just as easily be Asana, Jira or Trello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also get a set of apps to open. I change these up fairly often, but for right now I\u2019ve added <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://iterm2.com/\">iTerm2</a>, <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a>, <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/\">Craft</a>, <a href=\"https://bear.app/\">Bear</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/\">Spotify</a> and my Apple calendar to the workflow. Adding apps is a drag-and-drop operation, so it\u2019s easy to change which apps are opened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I run a few terminal commands. These update <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a>, <a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh/\">Oh My Zsh</a>, node, and npm. They also run some maintenance scripts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want Alfred to use <a href=\"https://www.iterm2.com/\">iTerm2</a>, instead of the default terminal, you\u2019ll need to tell Alfred.

So I\u2019ve programmed a webhook to send me a cheerful message on Slack as a direct message. I get a notification on my phone while I\u2019m in the kitchen making coffee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want, you can even use <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.alfredapp.com/remote/\">Alfred Remote</a> (paid) and create a button on your phone to start your workflows. If you have a Mac with a touchbar, you can use an app like <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.boastr.net/\">BetterTouchTool</a> (paid) and create a global touch bar button to do the same thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to integrate a Slack notification, you\u2019ll need to do this as a <a href=\"https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics\">Slack app</a>. You used to be able to create an <a href=\"https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks\">incoming webhook</a> in Slack, grab the needed url, and put it in the last action inside of a curl payload. There\u2019s a tutorial <a href=\"https://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-to-integrate-webhooks-slack-api/how-to/2015/10/20\">here</a>. But the Slack app method is a newer way to do something similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the last step in this workflow, I get a notification on my computer. This could include an audio alert sound or even Spotify playlist, but I like peace and quiet, so my notifications are silent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>End-of-Day Workflow</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My end-of-day workflow is the simplest \u2013 it just closes every app, no customization required. That means that it also closes every tab in my browser. You could add a System Command to shut down your computer for you as well. I like this workflow because when my work day is over, it\u2019s done! I\u2019m not tempted to check that open pull request one last time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3360\" height=\"2234\" data-attachment-id=\"3401\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2022/12/12/how-to-save-time-with-alfred-stream-deck-and-apple-shortcuts/good-night-2402x-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?fit=3360%2C2234&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3360,2234\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"good-night-2402x-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?resize=3360%2C2234&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3401\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?w=3360&amp;ssl=1 3360w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?resize=1536%2C1021&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?resize=2048%2C1362&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/good-night-2402x-1.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>My end-of-day workflow in the Alfred App.&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Development Workflow</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a third workflow that sets things up specifically for development work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one starts again with an external trigger.

I prefer <a href=\"https://around.co/\">Around</a>, but it\u2019s a bit more limited in what is possible to automate. Still, anything that has a URL, or a key combo, or that can be put in a Shortcut, can be added to the Stream Deck.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m currently working on a third profile that lets me use the Stream Deck with GitHub to monitor things like GitHub notifications and pull requests. But let\u2019s call that a work in progress!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stream Deck lets you add additional automations including home automation, various sound and image editing automations, and gaming automation.

It developed from our<a href=\"https://tumblrdatascience.wordpress.com/mentions/tumblr-analytics-team/\"> </a>interest in creating clearer job postings for hiring and detecting the company&#8217;s technical and non-technical growth areas. As such, it embodies&nbsp;our <a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/\">Automattic Creed</a>\u2019s reminder to \u201c<a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/never-stop-learning/\">never stop learning</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have used the Skill Matrix for many purposes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Develop job postings;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Evaluate the strengths of data professionals;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Evaluate people\u2019s potential areas of improvement;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Assign projects to people based on their strengths;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the information for hiring to complement our knowledge gaps;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Decide and pick learning programs for the team;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pair people for learning;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Assign people to projects based on their complementary skills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool can be handy for data-related roles such as Data Scientist, Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Analytics Engineer, and more. The Matrix can also help you, as an individual Automattician, discover your strengths and areas where you may wish to improve. This increased awareness is valuable when planning new learning opportunities and applying for jobs, as you can focus on developing the most relevant skills for the type of role you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The background</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the current project, we designed a spreadsheet by making an inventory of two dimensions<strong>, our needs and competencies\u2014</strong>that is, the tasks we need to perform to fulfill our mission and the skills plus tools we need to complete those tasks\u2014which, combined, let us perform our analytical duties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Needs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take the mission of Tumblr\u2019s <strong>D</strong>ata <strong>S</strong>cience <strong>A</strong>nalytics team, \u201c<strong>Supporting the business by providing accurate and timely metrics and insights to drive data-driven decisions.\u201d </strong>To achieve it, we must first assess the dimension of the need as a team. Some of our needs are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Designing and implementing relevant metrics and KPIs to monitor the business;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reporting and presenting the state of the products across the business;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Aiding in making data-driven decisions by performing data analysis;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Experimenting with products and fostering their growth through data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With these needs in mind, we select tools and develop competencies to fulfill them: Some tools we habitually use are SQL, Python, Looker, Apache Airflow, PySpark, Hue, Hive, Jira, scala, PHP, Kafka, Java, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Competencies</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We created a list of more than seventy competencies by considering our needs and the relevant tools. Then we categorized the skill expertise into the four levels we use internally: newbie, basic, comfortable, and expert. Finally, we combined the list of competencies and the level of expertise to design the skill matrix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the list of competencies created, we expected the ability to\u2026</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Perform insightful deep dives (Exploratory Data Analysis);</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Develop Dashboards;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Define KPIs and metrics;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interpret the results of A/B tests;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Design experiments;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Define requirements from vague statements;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide reliable estimates for assigned tasks;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take on tasks and projects from start to completion;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Coordinate tasks between multiple stakeholders;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Establish rapport and positive professional relationships with team members;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Build data pipelines;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write and present the results of experiments and analysis clearly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It also helped us to think about the following categories when creating the list of competencies:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Technical competencies;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Domain knowledge;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Project management and execution;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Teamwork and communication;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leadership skills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have <em>your</em> list of competencies, you can add the horizontal expertise dimension to them to produce the final skill matrix. On the vertical axis, you would have the competencies, and on the horizontal axis, the level of expertise in your desired scale. You can see below a small example of some of the skills we measure for our purposes:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Competency</strong></td><td><strong>newbie</strong></td><td><strong>basics</strong></td><td><strong>comfortable</strong></td><td><strong>expert</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Perform insightful deep dives (Exploratory Data Analysis)</td><td></td><td></td><td>x</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Design and develop dashboards and compelling data visualizations</td><td></td><td></td><td>x</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Develop efficient data pipelines&nbsp;</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>Design and analyze A/B testing experiments</td><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Communicate clearly technical topics to non-technical audiences</td><td></td><td></td><td>x</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A simplistic example of a skill matrix assessment</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use cases</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Self-assessment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One beneficial way anyone can use a skill matrix is to perform a self-assessment of their current skills. I did this when I wanted to level up my technical skills as a Data Scientist upon joining the team. I reviewed the skills I had and my expertise in each one, and compared them to the needs of our team. This way, I discovered that, even though I was already an expert in SQL, I didn\u2019t fully understand our data pipeline system since it was based on Apache Airflow, a tool I didn\u2019t use often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I followed up by requesting feedback for resources to learn Apache Airflow for data colleagues in Automattic. Then I bought some books and invested many hours studying, designing, and developing data pipelines. The Skill Matrix, and the insight it provided me, enabled me to make valuable contributions to our team\u2019s data pipeline and increased my understanding of our data systems. I have used this method many more times to \u201cnever stop learning\u201d and focus on impactful development areas. It has helped every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Elaborating accurate job descriptions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not uncommon to see unicorn-like skill demands in job postings, where it seems they are requesting multiple roles for one person. These job postings usually arise due to a problem of inaccurate needs assessments, resulting in a delayed and complex hiring process. As candidates with only a small set of the demanded skills might be discouraged from applying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another beneficial way of using the Skill Matrix is to assess the team\u2019s needs and align the skills in the job description with those needs. One would use the Skill Matrix to understand where more expertise is needed and write a job description that tailors to those particular skills, resulting in more detailed and accurate job descriptions and a more efficient hiring process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Skill Matrix is a tool anyone can use for many different purposes, and one that is relatively easy to build once we consider dimensions such as competencies, tools, and needs.<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YRfepfxHOQ7PHbGY_0ftCeSxhDAzCiMm4_rjMmEHmn4/edit#gid=0\"> </a>Through the exercise of designing one, you will gain an increased awareness of yourself, and improve your ability to plan for your objectives and prepare for data-related roles.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>We use experiments to model reality (sometimes to create alternative realities as in A/B experiments), to understand reality, and ultimately, to make decisions moving us ever closer to our goals. Improving iteratively, we learn not only from successful experiments but also from failed attempts. Experiments are important because they provide us with measurements. And measurements outweigh opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>One accurate measurement is worth more than a thousand expert opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n<cite>Grace Hopper</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color\" style=\"color:#316372\">But&#8230; can we experiment in hiring?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to experiments, A/B tests tend to be the default option, but A/B tests are not always well suited for the data we have for hiring. There are some reasons for that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We cannot really assure randomness or independence in the sample.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Causal actions are not under our control.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The opportunity cost could be very expensive.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We have a limited number of experimental units.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We cannot always assure that units do not interfere with one another.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also important ethical considerations:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Our data is linked with people who deserve our maximum respect.

The answer is YES! We won&#8217;t use A/B tests but alternate methods.

In our<a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/\"> creed</a>, we say that<a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/status-quo/\"> there is no such thing as a status quo</a>. And this is the spirit we aim for in our statistical studies: &#8220;<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://medium.com/swlh/3-tips-on-fostering-a-culture-of-experimentation-in-your-company-71438ce02476\"><em>experimentation is a mindset, a team sport, a company culture</em></a>&#8221; that should soak every corner of the company if we want to innovate and improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal was to foster people&#8217;s curiosity, to have people rethink about what is obvious, and distill <strong>ideas out of the beaten track</strong> that could improve our processes and outcomes. This is the fuel of our research!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://talentp2.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/image-9.webp?w=669\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4348\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Our Experimentation Culture Creed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Questions that have sparked detailed data research</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The results came fast and we have been able to launch meaningful investigations in an environment where we thought experiments might be challenging to do. Fancy some examples?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would <strong><em>you</em></strong> ask?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We can use data to understand relationships between elements in our funnel to make the hiring process lighter and more straightforward for our candidates and ourselves. For instance, we investigated code test scorecards and their correlations with getting an offer after following funnel stages, including the trial. As a result of several of these studies we were able to (1) remove some scorecard items that weren&#8217;t effective or were redundant/overlapping, making the process more agile; (2) move scorecards to a different place in the funnel to make the process more fluid; and (3) modify priorities integrating the new learnings, to make the process more accurate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We studied correlations of our process and stage length with the candidate&#8217;s success with no conclusive result<strong>. </strong>Important fact: we consider this statistical study to be really insightful too ==&gt; we learn from not-so-unsuccessful research.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We experimented with removing some stages in our hiring process with diverse results, some of them inspiring.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We aggregated stats and looked at independence between variables (With <em>\u03c7</em><sup>2</sup> tests) to answer to what extent reapplicants (people applying two+ times for the same position) are successful candidates. We got to understand some particularities of reapplicants vs first-time applications and we discovered that under some circumstances, reapplicants have been up to two times more likely to be hired than regular applicants. Having learned this, we took action to tap into this fact where it happens.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We have launched several analyses comparing two different funnel paths&#8217; behaviors. We&#8217;ve taken a look at the time-to-hire for successful candidates, the passthrough rate for each stage, and the time in stage. This has originated some data-backed decisions and funnel changes down the line that made our process more lightweight, faster, and more authentic.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Thanks to asking the right questions, our studies have given us a better understanding of referral dynamics including scenarios where our referrals happen more or less often and when they are more likely to end up in a new hire. This study has originated actionable recommendations that we are implementing!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Excited about helping people try out <strong><em>their</em> ideas?

    "content": "\n<p>One&nbsp;distinguishing feature of Automattic\u2019s work culture is a team rotation, through which an individual can move from one team to another. A rotation can happen for a few reasons: to \u201ctry out\u201d a new role and gain new skills, to backfill an understaffed team, or to cultivate cross-pollination and diversity across the company. Some rotations are several months long, while others may turn into a permanent team switch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tumblr, which is part of Automattic, is currently hiring <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/job/senior-data-scientist-tumblr/\">data scientists</a> and <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/job/search-engineer-tumblr-content-discovery/\">search engineers</a> and <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/job/senior-machine-learning-engineer-search-and-recommendations/\">machine learning engineers</a>. Thanks to this system of rotations, last year we were able to fill a few of these positions, on the Tumblr Core Data Science team, internally. This team contributes to Tumblr recommendation systems, discovery feeds, targeted push notifications, user-interest profiling, and computational advertisement. Team members work on designing, developing, and maintaining large-scale machine learning algorithms, data pipelines, and backend services to connect users with the content they love. Our data infrastructure is built on top of open source big data frameworks such as Apache Spark and Scalding, orchestrated by Apache Airflow and with a PHP backend layer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, Adam and Vicki, two Automatticians who experienced a rotation onto the team, tell us about their work in data, their rotations, and being part of Automattic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tell us about your background in data</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicki:</strong> I started out as an economics major because I wanted to work with both words and data. In one interview early in my career, I actually stated that my dream job was a journalist for <em>The Economist</em> because I could do both econometrics and written analysis of complex world issues. My first job was as a data analyst, and it turned out that you can&#8217;t do complex analysis without programming, so I became interested in SAS and R, the two popular statistical languages at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, I started working with Python and<a href=\"https://increment.com/software-architecture/architecture-for-generations/\"> Hadoop</a>, and became really interested in data science, which was a brand-new field at the time \u2014 although with a lot of prior history from analytics and database management and engineering :).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve since been working in data science, and most recently, engineering, for the last six years, including a lot of time spent consulting with Fortune 500 companies on what their data pipelines, ML ops, and modeling systems should look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I came to Automattic, it was in a lot of ways like closing the loop on my <em>Economist</em> dreams, because I get to do a lot of writing, as well as a ton of engineering and analysis to make the writing happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adam:</strong> Data has been in my mind since primary school. Ten-year-old me asked my dad about a book he was reading. The title on the cover said <em>Neural Networks</em>. He said it was a manual for making computers smart, just like Transformers. How cool was that?! Too bad I didn&#8217;t know any linear algebra at the time. I thought &#8220;computers must be interesting&#8221; and went off to play with Legos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later, I found that same creative joy of Legos in learning HTML. By the time I finished high school, I was already a freelance web developer. Along the way, <a href=\"https://adamadam.blog/2021/10/03/dont-waste-time-on-boring-programming-lessons/\">I learned Python and SQL</a>. Eventually, I got involved with government projects, San Francisco startups, and fundraising for my own products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I realized that computers had already become smart, just like my dad told me. I could have a conversation with my phone while my car was driving me to an automated grocery store. Transformers were clearly just a matter of time now. The only problem was I had no idea how any of that worked!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I caught up with mathematics through <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm\">MIT OCW</a>, did a bunch of courses, and concluded with Stanford&#8217;s AI professional program. I now understood more, which was good, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all came together when I joined Automattic. I had space to build my data muscles while growing as a software engineer. Eventually, I was ready for a rotation in the Tumblr Core Data Science team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tell us about your rotation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicki:</strong> In February, my team, which was previously working on platform experience at<a href=\"http://wordpress.com\"> WordPress.com</a>, started a rotation on Tumblr, working side by side with the content discovery and recommendations teams there. I enjoyed the rotation so much, and the set of problems we&#8217;re working with at Tumblr with respect to data and machine learning and the user experience, that I decided to stay. For more about what I do,<a href=\"https://applyingml.com/mentors/vicki-boykis/\"> check out this recent interview</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that has really struck me about Automattic is the flexibility and fluidity here: teams are constantly in flux and people move around based on the needs of the company and the preferences of the individual. We hire people based on strong engineering fit as opposed to specific job titles within divisions. As Anne wrote in this<a href=\"https://nomad.blog/2020/12/08/you-might-not-love-working-at-automattic-if/\"> wonderful post about Automattic culture</a>, this means that you may not work on a single focus for years \u2014 although some do \u2014 and that the team you\u2019re on will likely evolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adam:</strong> At Tumblr, I worked with content recommendations. Our goal was to connect users with fascinating writeups, art, and videos. To get there, we read white papers, debated equations, and tried different models. My favorite part was pondering unexpected philosophical questions: <em>What does it mean for two things to be similar?</em> <em>What makes a piece of content interesting?</em> <em>How do you define high quality?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting up to speed was like climbing a challenging mountain: exhausting but deeply fulfilling. The scientific rigor was as strong as at Stanford, and for a good reason: projects can take a long time. A wrong assumption or a formula early on may cost you months of delays. Caring about the details pays off. In web apps, many ideas may be roughly prototyped in a day or a week. In data, a day is how long you wait for the results of a database query.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Vicki, I returned to my previous team after my rotation.&nbsp; Three years into my data journey, I realized my motivation for pursuing a career in data <a href=\"https://adamadam.blog/2022/01/17/2021-in-review-goals-bankruptcy-personal-breakthroughs-and-a-bike-accident/\">was more of &#8220;I should&#8221; than &#8220;I want to.&#8221;</a> It was a difficult realization, but a liberating one, and it allowed me to listen to my heart \u2014 which was with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What do you enjoy about working on various products in the Automattic ecosystem?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicki:</strong> I really enjoy the scale and impact that we have around shared written communication, in a positive way. One of the things I love is how we dogfood the act of blogging,<a href=\"http://veekaybee.github.io/2021/07/17/p2s/\"> in the form of internal blogs called P2s</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, there are conversations around how social networks negatively impact our world today, and for good reason. I like working on social products whose mission is to democratize publishing, making the world wide web slightly better, and<a href=\"https://automattic.com/about/\"> with a focus on open source</a>. For me, that\u2019s&nbsp; Tumblr, where you can freely post and find creative content \u2014&nbsp; and now support creators \u2014 or WordPress, which empowers both bloggers and entrepreneurs to realize their ideas. There is a lot of positive potential in this ecosystem, and I&#8217;m excited to be a part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adam</strong>: Besides the impact that Vicki covered so well, I enjoy three things: safety, growth, and friendships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Safety, because I don&#8217;t have to worry about sending the wrong message. When I share my passions, people smile and help me pursue them at Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growth, because even after 15 years in the industry, I keep learning new things. Every product is a new challenge, every team has a unique perspective, and every day feels fresh. It works both ways, too: during my Tumblr rotation we were building a REST API, and I brought in a lot of relevant experience to the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friendships, because I often get to meet fantastic people, have insightful conversations with them, and then stay in touch long after our work is finished.&nbsp;</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>When we started working on <a href=\"https://data.blog/2021/03/16/explat-automattics-experimentation-platform/\">Automattic\u2019s new experimentation platform (ExPlat)</a>, it became clear that we needed to agree on the development practices for the project. Achieving&nbsp;consensus was critical, given <a href=\"https://distributed.blog/2019/06/27/automattic-ceo-matt-mullenweg-on-fully-distributed-company/\">Automattic\u2019s fractal nature</a> and <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2020/04/five-levels-of-autonomy/\">its strong emphasis on autonomy</a>. In practice, these attributes lead to a high variability of project development cultures across the company, depending on specific project needs and individual backgrounds. As the tech lead for the project, I proposed some principles and practices on <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">our P2 workspace</a>, which led to discussion and iteration over time. We\u2019re sharing the most recent version of the document here with minimal edits, in the hope that it will be useful for others who are working on similar projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Top principle: we\u2019re building for maintenance</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re building a robust new system, not another quick-and-dirty library. A maintenance mindset will help ensure that ExPlat is built to last, and that it doesn\u2019t become <a href=\"https://data.blog/2021/04/14/architecting-explat-automattics-new-experimentation-platform/\">yet another legacy experimentation solution at Automattic</a>. The following principles and practices derive from this mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"283\" data-attachment-id=\"3182\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/06/explats-development-principles-and-practices/xkcd-standards/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xkcd-standards.png?fit=500%2C283&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,283\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"xkcd-standards\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xkcd-standards.png?fit=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xkcd-standards.png?fit=500%2C283&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xkcd-standards.png?resize=500%2C283&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3182\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xkcd-standards.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xkcd-standards.png?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">XKCD Comic on Standards</a>.

The only way to be confident that code actually runs is to run it. In addition, full test coverage makes refactoring easier and serves as documentation. When it comes to the full coverage rule, we should only make exceptions around experimental code that is likely to change. However, such code should be clearly marked as experimental.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New code must adhere to the coding conventions of its environment</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This means no phpcs warnings in PHP, full linting in Python, small maintainable queries in <a href=\"https://data.blog/2021/02/22/sql-a-common-language-for-the-whole-data-team/\">SQLT</a>, a build that fully passes in <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/abacus/\">Abacus</a>, etc. Ideally, we will add new conventions where there are gaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>All public-facing functionality must be fully documented</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing documentation can be a pain, but trying to guess what undocumented code does can be worse. If code is meant to be used outside the module in which it\u2019s defined, it should be fully documented. This includes typed input arguments, typed return values, English descriptions, usage examples for non-trivial functionality, and P2 posts or wiki pages for additional detail when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>All production code must be reviewed before it\u2019s committed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve adopted <a href=\"https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/\">Google\u2019s code review standards</a> and recommend reviewing the resources on <a href=\"https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/\">how to do a code review</a> and <a href=\"https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/\">how to author changes</a>. All changes should get their initial review within 24 hours from the time the author says that they\u2019re ready for review. Emergency patches and experimental (i.e., non-production) code may be reviewed after they\u2019re committed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strive for small, simple, and descriptive changes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s better to err on the side of implementing changes that are too small \u2014 such simplicity makes changes easy to approve and merge (see also <a href=\"https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html\">Google&#8217;s guide to small changelists</a>). The code author should provide context, links, and inline comments to help communicate the background and intent of a change, especially since the reviewer may not be online at the same time as the author to ask questions synchronously. Changes will be considered a work-in-progress until the build passes, unless the author has clearly communicated the reasons why a build fails (e.g., temporary issues with external dependencies).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Address all review comments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Address all review comments by making a code change, replying, marking as done, or responding with an emoji reaction. Communicate that comments have been received or the intent to address with code changes. This may include prompts for clarity or discussions. Effective and timely communication is key, in line with <a href=\"https://automattic.com/expectations/\">the general expectations from all Automatticians</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fix bugs before writing new code</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/\">Joel Spolsky said it many years ago</a>, and we believe it\u2019s still applicable today. In addition to making extensions to our code easier, keeping the bug count at zero should also increase user confidence in our systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Don\u2019t wait for hack weeks to refactor messy code</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Requirements change and evolve, so it\u2019s inevitable that once-clean code might need to be rewritten to accommodate new use cases and a better understanding of the problem space. To avoid ending up with a pile of unmaintainable code, we should refactor as we go between work on functional changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Save time by spending time on design and architecture</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s common for developers to have a bias toward writing code rather than thoroughly discussing requirements. However, for non-trivial changes, it is often best to get some consensus within the team before jumping in to write code. In fact, some pre-coding discussions may save time on code reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sound interesting? Join us!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re currently hiring <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/job/senior-experimentation-backend-engineer/\">a Senior Experimentation Backend Engineer</a>.

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2021/04/14/architecting-explat-automattics-new-experimentation-platform/",
    "content": "\n<p>Last month, my colleague Aaron Yan published <a href=\"https://data.blog/2021/03/16/explat-automattics-experimentation-platform/\">a broad overview of Automattic\u2019s new Experimentation Platform (ExPlat)</a>. This month, we\u2019ll dive deeper into ExPlat\u2019s architecture and design, explain how the landscape at Automattic informed our architectural decisions, and describe the platform\u2019s main components. Future posts will share details on each component and other aspects of experimentation at Automattic, so please subscribe to join us on this journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The pre-ExPlat landscape</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Architecting a software solution is similar to architecting physical structures: It requires an understanding of the landscape and how existing building blocks can be used to address stakeholder needs. At Automattic, our landscape includes the various systems that serve content to users and enable data analysis at scale, as well as a collection of existing solutions to A/B experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main components of Automattic\u2019s infrastructure relevant to ExPlat are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\" id=\"main-landscape-components\"><li>The WordPress.com production backend, which is written in PHP and backed by a collection of <a href=\"https://mariadb.org/\">MariaDB</a> instances managed by our Systems team. As MariaDB is a fork of MySQL, we\u2019ll refer to the production databases as MySQL below. This component scales well and serves millions of users who host sites with us. It also powers other products in addition to WordPress.com, like Jetpack. As such, it is a mission-critical shared resource, and we must take care to ensure that deployed changes don\u2019t degrade its performance.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a></sup></li><li>Various front ends like static landing pages, the WordPress.com management UI (<a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/\">Calypso</a>), and mobile apps that allow end users to consume content and manage their sites.</li><li>The Hadoop-based data lake, which we use to run analyses and various ETL (extract-transform-load) workflows that are too costly to run on the end-user-facing backend. This component includes <a href=\"https://data.blog/2021/02/22/sql-a-common-language-for-the-whole-data-team/\">the Ganymedes system</a>, which makes it easy for anyone at the company to deploy well-validated ETL workflows using SQL or Spark. When we started work on ExPlat, Ganymedes was still a new solution. Thanks to the great work of Automattic\u2019s Data Engineering team, Ganymedes has evolved rapidly to address ExPlat\u2019s needs and the needs of many other Automattic projects.</li><li>Tracks, our home-grown user analytics solution. Tracks has clients in many of Automattic\u2019s products that collect data and <a href=\"https://data.blog/2016/11/22/bulk-log-analytics-with-hive/\">send it back to Hadoop via Kafka</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When we started working on ExPlat in late 2019, we had some A/B experimentation solutions at Automattic. Those solutions have helped inform our requirements for ExPlat, and their existence de-risked the project: We were certain that we\u2019d have enthusiastic <em>experimenters</em>, i.e., internal customers who want to run better experiments to inform their decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to experimenters, we also had some buy-in from the business to support ExPlat in the long term. Our mission is to provide both the tools and the help needed to improve experimentation infrastructure and culture at Automattic. Even though some experimentation tools existed prior to ExPlat, they had no long-term owners. As a result, experiments failed due to instrumentation issues, and wrong conclusions were drawn due to analysis bugs and tooling limitations. In short, <em>the trustworthiness of experiments was too low</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main A/B experimentation tools that we were aiming to replace with ExPlat were:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/7454ab0e6300276044227e6f9f3484c4a8628e5a/client/lib/abtest\">The Calypso JavaScript abtest library</a>, which enabled A/B experiments on the Calypso front end.</li><li>The WordPress.com PHP abtest library, which enabled A/B experiments on the backend and static landing pages.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/09/05/easier-ab-tests-with-automattics-own-tool-hypotheses/\">Hypotheses analysis tool</a>, which supported limited analysis of A/B experiments run by the above libraries.</li><li>Various other dashboards and ad-hoc analysis approaches.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, we were hoping to gradually improve the existing tools, rather than embark on the daunting task of building a new system from scratch. However, a few factors led us toward building ExPlat as a new standalone project:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>While both the Calypso and WordPress.com libraries recorded events in Tracks, they were unaware of each other, meaning that A/B experiments that affected both the front end and the backend were hard to coordinate.</li><li>Both libraries relied on hardcoded A/B experiment definitions, meaning that starting and stopping experiments required code changes. This led to some experiments running for years without a straightforward way to stop them automatically or even detect that they\u2019re running.</li><li>Hypotheses had improved the rigor of experiment analysis at Automattic, but it relied on bespoke Scala and PHP code that lacked adequate test coverage. With the Ganymedes solution (which didn\u2019t exist when Hypotheses was implemented), it became much easier to run well-validated ETL workflows. Such validation is essential for implementing <a href=\"https://experimentguide.com/\">trustworthy experiments</a>.</li><li>Hypotheses required manual setup of a new analysis funnel for each metric, which led to inconsistent metric definitions and many avoidable human errors in experiment analysis. It also supported only conversion metrics, while many experimenters were interested in revenue metrics.</li><li>Due to the lack of central ownership, all the existing tools had accrued long lists of known bugs and feature requests.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, we pretty much had everything we needed: Systems that could support a scalable modern experimentation platform, a clear view of requirements by active experimenters, a set of tools to provide inspiration and improve on, and buy-in from stakeholders to build ExPlat. With all of that in place, it was just a matter of architecting the system, building it, and taking experimentation at Automattic to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ExPlat\u2019s main components and architecture</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our overall architecture is presented in the following diagram, where arrows roughly represent the flow of read/writes. For example, the uni-directed path from MySQL to the Analysis UI means that the UI only reads the analysis tables, while the bi-directed path from MySQL to the Management UI means that it also writes back to the production database.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2860\" height=\"2404\" data-attachment-id=\"3154\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?fit=2860%2C2404&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2860,2404\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"explat-experimentation-platform-architecture\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?fit=300%2C252&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?fit=1024%2C861&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?resize=2860%2C2404&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"ExPlat's architecture\" class=\"wp-image-3154\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?w=2860&amp;ssl=1 2860w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?resize=300%2C252&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?resize=1024%2C861&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?resize=768%2C646&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?resize=1536%2C1291&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/explat-experimentation-platform-architecture.png?resize=2048%2C1721&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As the diagram shows, ExPlat can be broken up into three areas: management, assignment, and analysis. Each area has different operational requirements and responsibilities. All areas share some data through MySQL and Hadoop, but they are otherwise independent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Experiment management </strong>comprises two parts: Manual changes by the experimenter to define and control an experiment, and automatic changes by the system as part of the experiment lifecycle. The former consists of fairly straightforward CRUD (create-read-update-delete) operations on the experiment definition tables, with strict validations to ensure data integrity. The latter is done by a backend job that handles experiment status transitions and owner Slack notifications. Experimenters manage experiments using <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/abacus/\">Abacus, our open source UI</a>, which will be discussed in the next post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Experiment assignment </strong>is the only area that interacts directly with end users. Its design will be covered in a separate post. The brief summary is that the assignment PHP library reads the experiment configuration from MySQL (via caches that reduce read load), but it doesn&#8217;t write to any MySQL tables. Instead, assignments are logged as Tracks events, and make their way to Hadoop and back to MySQL using a process we call reverse-sqooping. Relying on Tracks for assignment logging improves scalability and makes it easier to control the write load on MySQL. Assignments are served to clients via the API, with the exception of the WordPress.com backend that gets the assignments directly from the PHP library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Experiment analysis</strong> is done on top of Hadoop tables, as it requires Tracks data and specialized tools. This area includes our Ganymedes ETL jobs and a Python job, which employs <a href=\"https://yanirseroussi.com/2016/06/19/making-bayesian-ab-testing-more-accessible/\">Bayesian models</a> to provide metric estimates and recommendations to experimenters. The analysis results are fed back to MySQL and displayed to experimenters on Abacus. We will share the details of our analysis approach in a future post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Breakdown by component</strong>: Another way of looking at the system is by component/module. This roughly corresponds to the vertically-aligned parts of the diagram. Specifically:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>MySQL tables are the source of truth for experiment definition and assignment.</li><li>Hadoop tables are the source of truth for metric values and experiment analysis.</li><li>PHP libraries are responsible for writing all the non-analysis MySQL tables. They also provide interfaces for querying these tables.</li><li>The PHP libraries are accessed by non-PHP clients through APIs that correspond to the library functionality.</li><li>The PHP backend job is responsible for managing the experiment lifecycle and sending lifecycle-related Slack notifications to the experiment owner.</li><li>The Ganymedes and Python jobs are responsible for experiment analysis and sending analysis-related Slack notifications to the experiment owner.</li><li>The Abacus UI is the only place experimenters need to access for experiment management and analysis, superseding all existing tools (hardcoded experiment configuration, Hypotheses, ad-hoc dashboards, spreadsheets, etc.).</li><li>End-user clients (Calypso, mobile, etc.) are responsible for exposing end users to the experiment variations.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Join us!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve covered the architecture, we\u2019re ready to go deeper into the implementation details of each component. These will be covered in posts over the coming months, so make sure you subscribe to get updates.

    "content": "\n<p>Over the past 18 months, the Decision Science team has been building the <strong>Experimentation Platform (ExPlat)</strong>: a tool to help our colleagues run experiments to improve customer experiences, inform product decisions, and quantify the impact of newly released features on many of Automattic\u2019s products such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/create-website/\">WordPress.com</a>, <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a>, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>, and <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">more</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this multi-part series, we will take you under the hood and share some of what we loved about building our new Experimentation Platform. This post is an overview of the platform and what\u2019s on our project roadmap. Future posts will include deeper insights into our architecture, assignment system, and the\u00a0open source UI called <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/abacus\"><em>Abacus</em></a> that we use for experiment management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why do we run experiments?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many teams at Automattic want to measure how new ideas affect a user\u2019s experience. Running an experiment provides the confidence and scientific rigor to quantify the effect across metrics important to our business such as new user signups, purchase conversions, and incremental revenue. Running experiments also allows data to inform and drive our decisions instead of the <a href=\"https://www.enricdurany.com/agile-startup-entrepreneur/hippos-highest-paid-person-opinion-data-driven-decision-making/\">highest paid person\u2019s opinion</a> (HiPPO).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing trends before and after a new feature is released can be a very manual, intensive process, and it can be difficult to attribute changes to a given feature because of confounding variables that may be influencing the results. These analyses usually have to account for things like seasonality, current events, and competing new releases from fellow colleagues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where experimentation and the power of randomness comes to the rescue! A common experiment we run is called an A/B test where we randomly assign users to one of two user experiences: the `A` group receives the default user experience while the `B` group uses the newly designed feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because users are randomly assigned to each group, the confounding variables have an equal chance of affecting both groups, which means the only difference between the two variants is the new feature we introduced to the `B` group. Any difference in metric performance can be attributed to the new feature. This is the subtle brilliance and simplicity of A/B tests!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The new experimentation platform</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve built our new experimentation system with many years of historical experiments in mind. Our new system is called ExPlat, and in order to accommodate many types of experiments (A/B tests, multivariate, <a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/quasi-experimentation-at-netflix-566b57d2e362\">geo/quasi experiments</a>), we\u2019ve broken up the initiative into five parts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Experiment education and review hub</li><li>Experiment management UI</li><li>Experiment client libraries</li><li>Assignment system</li><li>Analysis and metric <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\">ETL</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>experiment education and review hub</em> is the starting point for experimenters at Automattic to learn how to design and deploy an experiment. We have an internal blog (called a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">P2</a>) for experimenters to get feedback on proposed experiments. We also have a wiki to share resources like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preflight_checklist\">pre-experiment checklist</a>, how to write a hypothesis, and how to create metrics that capture a project\u2019s intended impact. Experimenters can post their experiment design to discuss it with colleagues and ask for comments and reviews from our team.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1303\" height=\"744\" data-attachment-id=\"3119\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/16/explat-automattics-experimentation-platform/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_26_pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_26_pm.png?fit=1303%2C744&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1303,744\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen_Shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_26_PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_26_pm.png?fit=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_26_pm.png?fit=1024%2C585&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_26_pm.png?resize=1303%2C744&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3119\" class=\"wp-image-3119\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_26_pm.png?w=1303&amp;ssl=1 1303w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_26_pm.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_26_pm.png?resize=1024%2C585&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_26_pm.png?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1303\" height=\"744\" data-attachment-id=\"3120\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/16/explat-automattics-experimentation-platform/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_16_pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_16_pm.png?fit=1303%2C744&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1303,744\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen_Shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_16_PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_16_pm.png?fit=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_16_pm.png?fit=1024%2C585&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_16_pm.png?resize=1303%2C744&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3120\" class=\"wp-image-3120\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_16_pm.png?w=1303&amp;ssl=1 1303w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_16_pm.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_16_pm.png?resize=1024%2C585&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screen_shot_2021-03-09_at_4_19_16_pm.png?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>experiment management UI</em> is called Abacus and is an <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/abacus\">open source project</a>. It is where experimenters go to set up, deploy, and analyze their experiments. Abacus allows everyone at Automattic to run and analyze their experiments, not just engineers and data scientists. The UI helps people schedule their experiments, visualize experiment results, and remotely start and end experiments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abacus is an open source project because we believe in democratizing experimentation the same way <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/\">WordPress believes in democratizing publishing</a> and the &#8220;freedoms that come with open source.\u201d The experiment management UI is under the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/abacus/blob/master/LICENSE.md\">GPL license</a> and is available for anyone to contribute and/or use in their own experimentation system!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engineering teams can use the <em>client experiment libraries</em> when coding up the two variants of their A/B test. These client libraries simply consume the APIs that expose our assignment system and are built locally within a platform so that many different products within Automattic can run experiments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most experimenters will only use the experiment review hub, management UI, and the client libraries. By limiting experimenters to these three parts of the platform, we can help protect the integrity of experiments and create interfaces that make it easier to learn from experiments quickly and make it harder to commit time-consuming mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>assignment system</em> deterministically assigns users to an experiment group and takes into account the experiment model definitions in Abacus (eligibility, audience targeting, allocation ratios, etc). We offer two ways to assign users to experiments: real-time assignment and batch assignment. Most of our A/B tests are real-time assignments where users are assigned a test variation when they arrive at a specific experience in a product. Batch assignments are used for email experiments and <a href=\"https://data.blog/2019/06/10/using-ml-for-campaign-optimization-our-journey-to-marketing-science-at-automattic/\">machine-learning marketing campaigns</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>analysis and metric ETL</em> collects and processes performance metrics like conversion rates and average revenue per user for each running experiment. The experiment metric data is analyzed using <a href=\"https://yanirseroussi.com/2016/06/19/making-bayesian-ab-testing-more-accessible/\">Bayesian models</a> to generate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credible_interval\">credible intervals</a>. The analyzed experiment data is then visualized in Abacus where the experimenter can compare the performance of metrics across the experiment and decide which variation to deploy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experimenters conclude their experiment by sharing a summary comment on the experiment review hub about the results of their experiment. Each experiment contributes to a searchable repository of knowledge where we can share and learn from each other&#8217;s work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s on our roadmap?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The future of experimentation at Automattic is very bright! We\u2019ve released the new Experimentation Platform internally and one of our first major experiments was quantifying the influence of <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/pricing/\">monthly paid plans</a> where we observed a significant increase in paid purchase conversions. Many teams across Automattic have begun transitioning to the new Experimentation Platform, and we\u2019re adding support for many more use cases and clients, including email campaigns, the WordPress <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880\">iOS</a> apps, and Akismet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the near future, we hope to add new features like multivariate experiments and exclusive experiment groups. We also see opportunities to boost our education efforts and build a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWZcbQvD6hI&amp;ab_channel=YOW%21Conferences\">culture of experimentation</a> by creating an experiment review guild: training and educating engineering partners to help design and review experiments. By democratizing the experiment review and education to teams, we can build local pockets of experiment culture across the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay tuned!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first post in a series around Automattic\u2019s new Experimentation Platform. We\u2019ll have more members of the Decision Science team share their work on the different parts of the platform in future posts. If you\u2019re interested in solving similar challenges, <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/\">we\u2019re hiring</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you\u2019re interested in learning more about running experiments and building your own platform, we highly recommend the book <a href=\"https://experimentguide.com/\"><em>Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments</em></a> by Ron Kohavi, Diane Tang, and Ya Xiu.</p>\n",

What do you like about working in a globally distributed company so far?</em></em></em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two things that I love about working in Data for a globally distributed company: the flexibility to work in a manner that best fits my life and how it has made me more conscious of how I communicate ideas and issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, eight hours in an office was a mixture of the work I needed to do, browsing the internet for various hobby-related shenanigans, or wandering around the office annoying my colleagues to go for coffee. Not always dedicated precisely to the cause.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I can do dedicated bursts of work separated by dedicated time completely separate from the environment of work. If I need to take a little longer in the morning to get ready, I work a little later in the evening. Work fits around my life and not the other way around!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have also found that remote working, especially in a company as dedicated to written information like Automattic, has made me more conscious of how I communicate with others. The most significant change for me has been dropping the use of &#8220;this&#8221; and &#8220;that&#8221; from my communication, replacing them with the exact thing they are referencing. Data, especially analytics, is about the communication of ideas and anything that improves my clarity is for the better!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I look forward to the other ways that working for a globally distributed company changes my life!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anna Magdalena Kedzierska</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-14 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" data-attachment-id=\"3104\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/annak/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/annak.png?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"275,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"annak\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/annak.png?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/annak.png?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/annak.png?resize=275%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3104\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/annak.png?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/annak.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em><em><em><em><em>Anna, what is your favourite aspect of working remotely and in a global company?</em></em> </em></em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve always travelled and worked across the globe. Now that my life has changed and I&#8217;ve largely settled down with my family on the Spanish coast, working for a company that is global in nature allows me to maintain the same mindset of world presence even if the view from the window is constant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to exchange opinions and have conversations not only about work, but virtually anything between code and life. I truly appreciate the friendships I&#8217;ve made over the years. Due to the&nbsp;pandemic meetups are on hold, but when they are on, meetups are a unique and enlivening element to the work routine, and a great excuse for a trip to the other side of the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work-wise, being globally distributed means round-the-clock feedback and a multitude of perspectives on projects. It is a constant reminder to have an open mind and be considerate in your written and online interactions \u2014 mindful of cultures, preferences, schedules, communication styles.

A product that has an 85% sign up conversion rate in the USA or EU may have a dramatically lower one in Japan or India. I\u2019ve really learned to dig into quantitative data to find these types of usage differences on a global scale. Then, I use qualitative research to determine why the differences occur. I\u2019ve learned quite a bit in my tenure here, things that I never would have learned working in a company that operates strictly in North America.&nbsp;<br><br>Secondly, It\u2019s incredible to work with colleagues in different time zones. I use this to my advantage when it comes to project collaboration. If I ship designs in the evening at 7 p.m., I generally wake up to actionable feedback when I start my next work day, thanks to friends located elsewhere in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ra\u00fal Ant\u00f3n Cuadrado</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-16 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" data-attachment-id=\"3108\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/raul/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/raul.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"275,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"raul\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/raul.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/raul.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/raul.jpg?resize=275%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3108\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/raul.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/raul.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em><em><em>Ra\u00fal, what are the aspects of remote work in the Automattic way that you like most?</em></em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexibility, an amazing communication model, and being surrounded by global talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You start with time and space flexibility: you can work from anywhere and at any time you feel more productive and comfortable. The obvious result is work-life conciliation. But other corollaries are equally powerful: asynchrony, horizontality, and transparency. Three magic words that spark participation and enable people to contribute at their best. Flexibility sparks my creativity and makes me happy and productive: a win-win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asynchronous horizontal transparent communication requires text by default, and fosters a new paradigm of improvement by iteration, collaboration, and transparency where anything is documented. This allows mentioning people to see their take in a discussion. It allows new people to chime in and add value because&nbsp;discussions are open and transparent. This communication paradigm allows capitalization, linkability, reusability\u2026 of discussions, not just of results: that\u2019s brilliant! Divergent voices are not silenced, but remain present and can offer&nbsp;valuable input. I enjoy having access to this chaos of voices every single day. (Remember chaos doesn\u2019t mean lack of order but a truly complex, interesting and colorful order!)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With global distribution comes global talent. And the best perk you can possibly have is being surrounded by friendly brilliant colleagues.

Talent Analytics creates and maintains hiring data pipelines, metrics, and reporting for our hiring teams. Our mission is to help them make data-informed decisions and support them in creating the best candidate experience possible!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I live on a tiny island in the Indian Ocean, and if Automattic was not globally distributed, I could not be a part of it. I always think about how many talented folks there are among the billion plus people that inhabit the Indian subcontinent I live in, and this is what led me to join a hiring team at Automattic that focused at the time on recruiting from South Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, my interest in hiring led me to see how we could use hiring pipeline data to achieve&nbsp;our hiring goals. This is how I ended up on the Talent Analytics team. What I love most about working for a globally distributed company is that every day, I get to go to work and help build the workplace of the future. The fact that I get to do that alongside the most talented and amazing people I have ever had the privilege of working with, is definitely the icing on the cake!</p>\n",

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2021/02/22/sql-a-common-language-for-the-whole-data-team/",
    "content": "\n<p>Today, I wanted to share how we\u2019ve empowered colleagues outside the data engineering team to write their own data transformations by overcoming coding language barriers. Within our Data team, there are several specializations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Data Analysts</strong> create dashboards and analyze data for business leads and product teams across the company.</li><li><strong>Data Scientists</strong> apply machine learning technology at Automattic.</li><li><strong>Data Engineers </strong>build the infrastructure and data pipelines to support data analysts and data scientists.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of years ago we faced a problem with data transformations. We wrote data pipelines in Scala and executed them in Spark. While data scientists and data analysts at Automattic know which data they need and in which format, most of them do not know Scala very well. Setting up these pipelines and writing the data transformations was thus the responsibility of a small team of data engineers, and they soon became a bottleneck for the work of data analysts and data scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To empower data scientists and data analysts, and free up some of our data engineers\u2019 time, we created a toolset to allow everyone to transform and prepare the data according to their needs. This solution is based on writing transformations in pure SQL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why SQL?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Everyone on the team \u2014 from data analysts to data engineers \u2014 knows SQL.</li><li>SQL is well supported by Spark, and Spark is already used for existing transformations.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Problems, problems</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SQL is widely used, but there are few things we needed to overcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Code style. While Scala, Python, and other languages have standard formatting guidelines and tools, SQL is wild. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time discussing rules.</li><li>Even if you come up with a code style, it\u2019s hard to find tools that will check your SQL code. We are using a <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/command-line-formatter.html\">formatter</a> that comes with JetBrain IDEs.</li><li>You need to follow an exact SQL dialect. For example, column names in MySQL are not case sensitive, but they are in PostgreSQL. Hive and Impala differ, among other things, in the date functionality functions they provide. Thus, a query that runs fine in Hive might not run in Impala. We\u2019re using Spark for transformations but we also allow access to our data with Impala. People should always keep in mind which engine will execute their SQL code at a given moment.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Our solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We developed a framework on top of Spark SQL to give everyone the ability to build their own data pipelines. They don\u2019t need to know Scala (or even Python) to transform data. In addition to writing an SQL query, they define a data schema in the <a href=\"https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/idl.html\">Avro IDL language</a> and write tests using <a href=\"https://cucumber.io/\">Cucumber steps</a>. Cucumber comes with <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/cucumber-data-tables\">data tables</a> that conveniently define input and output data of ETLs.&nbsp; Any person at the company can create a PR on GitHub. They get a boost of confidence when they pass all the continuous integration tests, get reviewer approval, and enjoy working with the new data table they created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have used this system for more than a year now,&nbsp; and more than 700 data transformations have been written in this way. While the initial Data Engineering team has only five people, more than 50 people are now committing code and extending the usage of the data available in our data warehouse.</p>\n",

What has been your highlight so far?</em> </em></em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to focus on one aspect of Automattic which has been dramatically different than my experience&nbsp; at other companies \u2014 onboarding. At other companies, the first few days of work were filled with mandatory corporate training that no one actually valued and filing IT support desk tickets to set up all the accounts I would need to do actual work. At Automattic, the process is entirely different. Since part of the hiring process at Automattic is to carry out a project, I actually made my first contribution to production code for WordPress.com while I was doing my trial project. It was actually just a one-line change in a library, but it fixed a bug which had been known for over a year, which improved search results across most of the products at WordPress.com. It feels really great to be able to make an impact quickly. In this case, it was before I even had my first official day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t end there. The Automattic creed includes the statement \u201cI won\u2019t just work on things that are assigned to me.\u201d That is a value that I see practiced nearly every day. If I find a bug in a system that I use, but don\u2019t usually work on, and I want to try to fix it, it is perfectly fine (and even encouraged) to do so. While many companies have a culture of certain teams owning certain code, and they view outside collaborators as threats, the open culture at Automattic encourages collaboration. In other words, \u201cpull requests welcome.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anna Elek</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-19 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" data-attachment-id=\"3011\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/anna_e_gravatar/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"anna_e_gravatar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?resize=400%2C400&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3011\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em><em><em>Anna, what has been your highlight of working in our Analytics function?</em></em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>About a year ago, our entire team undertook a comprehensive reporting and infrastructure project to overhaul an existing suite of legacy topline metrics. Our goal was to pin down canonical definitions for these key metrics and pinpoint (data) sources of truth, design a dimensional database model, build a robust and modular new system to extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines and, finally, create brand new reporting in Looker to surface these metrics and track their progress vis-a-vis targets. The project meant about six months of work with my entire team on deck.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an amazing learning experience, and I think we all felt a lot of satisfaction finally tackling major legacy issues and sources of confusion systematically. Overall, I think two factors together made it a highlight of my time at Automattic: the chance \u2014 the mandate even \u2014 to focus on one huge endeavor together as a team, and the potential impact \u2014 improving the data user experience for so many colleagues. The pipelines we designed and built now deliver insights to nearly everyone at the company with a Looker account, from C-level through product squads and marketing teams. The central Executive Dashboard has several thousands of views, trust in this data has increased significantly, and both maintenance and further extensions have proven to be straightforward and manageable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Greg Ichneumon Brown</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-20 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/gregav.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-875\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><em><em><em>Greg, you\u2019re looking back at over nine years at Automattic. Can you think of a project that sticks out to you?</em></em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels strange to pick a project that I completed seven years ago, but it definitely was one of the more challenging problems I have worked on and it enabled a lot of subsequent projects to succeed. In 2013 I spent most of the year working to scale our Elasticsearch infrastructure so that we could build Related Posts for all WordPress.com and Jetpack sites (for free). Today it handles 300 million requests a day querying over 7 billion posts and has been happily working for years, so it is tough to remember that the project almost failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started by thinking a v1 of the project was doable in 3-4 months. It actually took over 12 months. During that time I found a lot of new and exciting ways to break WordPress.com. Scaling systems is hard, and I knew this. Honestly though, at some point it gets fairly depressing to keep solving one problem only to run into yet another problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I vividly remember talking to another engineer at the Grand Meetup about eight months into the project. His reflections were really helpful. Unlike most debugging problems, with a scaling problem you can\u2019t know what all of the problems actually are. You have to solve one before you will ever be able to see the next one. So it is very hard to predict how long getting something to work will take because you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That advice helped me to push through the next few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vicki Boykis</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-21 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" data-attachment-id=\"3064\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2020/11/05/one-pandemic-four-countries-and-six-different-stories/vicki/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"275,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"vicki\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?resize=275%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3064\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em><em>Vicki, what has been the highlight of your experience at Automattic so far?</em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve only been here a few months, but one of the most rewarding things about working at Automattic so far has been working on products that build on and encourage the spread of the open web and content creation by both individuals and small businesses. (This is a long way of <a href=\"https://automattic.com/about/\">restating our mission statement</a> to democratize publishing so that anyone with a story can tell it.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, with machine learning products for user-generated content, the challenge is in attracting users in the short-term, but we\u2019d like to keep users discovering new stories and content throughout our platform, and to empower creators to share more of their stories, and it\u2019s been really fun to work on that as a product goal.&nbsp;<br>So far, I\u2019ve worked on a project focused on helping our <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/happiness-engineer/\">Happiness Engineers</a> navigate live chat with machine learning and a project that involves surfacing better recommendations for topical content to users. Both of these have been radically different and equally interesting and rewarding because I\u2019m working directly with the people who benefit from better content discovery on our platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Demet Dagdelen</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-22 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/demet.jpg?w=794\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-718\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><em><em><em>Demet, can you tell us about your highlight of working at Automattic as a data scientist?</em></em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been at Automattic for five years and my time here has been characterized by one of my favorite lines from <a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/\">the Automattic creed</a>: I am in a marathon, not a sprint (<a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/marathon-sprint/\">but it\u2019s still a race</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve spent most of those years evangelizing a more data-driven and statistically sound approach to our marketing efforts. I\u2019ve held countless workshops on machine learning, causal inference, and the dangers of optimizing for the wrong metrics, taught multiple classes at our <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/04/12/welcoming-new-colleagues-a-data-based-story/\">all-company Grand Meetups</a>, wrote a plethora of internal documents for different types of audiences, and had many heated arguments along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the work was pure data science and engineering: We built <a href=\"https://data.blog/2018/11/15/introducing-pipe-the-automattic-machine-learning-pipeline/\">pipe</a>, our internal <a href=\"https://data.blog/2019/01/08/building-thousands-of-reproducible-ml-models-with-pipe-the-automattic-machine-learning-pipeline/\">machine learning pipeline</a>, I ran many <a href=\"https://data.blog/2019/06/10/using-ml-for-campaign-optimization-our-journey-to-marketing-science-at-automattic/\">smaller marketing campaigns and large-scale experiments</a>, and gathered hard evidence that moving away from manual segmentation to machine learning (ML) and constant experimentation-led targeting would eventually have an overwhelmingly positive impact on our bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, all of this work culminated in getting the green light and support to kick off the cross-divisional project of my dreams: Optimizing marketing sales campaigns using ML and uplift modelling. These revamped campaigns are now generating an additional 1 to 1.5 million USD in annualized incremental revenue compared to the pre-ML efforts \u2014 while emailing 50% fewer users! It is cutting edge, challenging, and exciting work with measurable impact and I am very excited for its future. Note: If this type of work at the intersection of machine learning, causal inference, engineering and marketing interests you, <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/senior-ml-software-engineer/\">we are currently hiring into the team</a>.</p>\n",

The kids were happy as \u2014 at the time \u2014 it meant a few extra months of summer vacation. Six months later, schools have shifted to online classes. We had to forgo our summer vacation and our kids no longer like it! For reasons unknown to me, my 9-year-old daughter likes taking her classes from my home office (thankfully, it&#8217;s only two hours each day) and my 5-year-old son is increasingly trying to make appearances during Zoom calls. I have shifted my work hours a bit to accommodate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way in which COVID-19 has affected my work, was in the initial days, when I was profusely checking virus-related news and the latest stats multiple times a day. It spurred anxiety and was also&nbsp; affecting my ability to concentrate on work. Inspired by<em> <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/\">Digital Minimalism</a></em><a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/\"> by Cal Newport</a> and supported by my team at Automattic, I went on a digital detox experiment for five weeks in July and August. For the experiment, I set fixed working hours and allowed myself no internet access outside those to reduce COVID-related and social media-induced anxiety. I spent most of my &#8220;offline&#8221; time reading books and spending time with the family. It was such a wonderful experience that the experiment is no longer an experiment \u2014 I&#8217;m following it indefinitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vicki Boykis</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-24 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" data-attachment-id=\"3064\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2020/11/05/one-pandemic-four-countries-and-six-different-stories/vicki/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"275,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"vicki\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?resize=275%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3064\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vicki.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em>Vicki, you joined Automattic during the COVID-19 pandemic. How has COVID-19 affected your work, and what difference has joining Automattic made for you?</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Automattic, I worked across a mix of distributed and on-site projects in a consultancy. In some way I was already working in a distributed manner because I usually only worked with three to four&nbsp;of my coworkers at a time, and we all met at an office about once a month. I also travelled to our other offices once a quarter. Although we switched to remote-first client work as the pandemic hit, a significant amount of the daily work involved&nbsp; synchronous meetings for&nbsp;collaborative facetime. This switch became harder to manage when both of my children were home for a three-month stretch beginning in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started at Automattic in June, it was clear from the beginning that distributed work could be very different, starting with my first interview, which was conducted entirely via text chat over Slack, and after that, at my own pace as I completed the trial project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I love is that everyone on my team works at their own pace throughout the day, with regular asynchronous check-ins. For me, personally, while the rest of my life during COVID-19 has been in complete chaos, shifting to working this way has been fantastic. We do have video chat sync points, but the assumption is that you default to remote-first, asynchronous, written communication, partly because everyone is in different timezones. The other thing that has been really valuable is the unlimited time off policy. The combination of async working styles, the ability to plan and pace my work mostly as it makes sense for me, and the ability to take days off as I need them have been invaluable for me during COVID-19, particularly as a parent of young kids who may need to take time off for caregiving.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Greg Ichneumon Brown</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-25 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/gregav.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-875\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><em><em>Greg, how have you been affected by COVID-19?</em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest stress on our family in recent years hasn\u2019t been COVID-19 but that I have spent the past three years dealing with a damaged spinal cord. The story is a long one. At my worst I could hardly walk through the house, was constantly in pain, and I was often falling down. In January 2019, I was finally properly diagnosed and <a href=\"https://greg.blog/2019/01/20/arachnoid-web-spinal-surgery/\">I had spinal cord surgery</a>. I&#8217;m still working on rehab and will be for at least another two years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I focus on rehab and work, my wife put her consulting business on hold to juggle all the other pieces of our lives. We have a 2-year-old and a 5-year-old, so starting kindergarten has been a different experience than we were expecting. We\u2019re also feeling risk averse due to the current condition of my body, so we\u2019re trying to navigate a constantly shifting schedule of online pandemic kindergarten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic as a company, and as individual people, has been very supportive throughout our multi-year ordeal and that has continued with COVID-19. Working at a distributed company makes dealing with my disability much easier and allows me to be more productive. Just the day-to-day flexibility in my schedule can make a lot of things easier. Work often feels like a break from the other things I am dealing with, but when I can work has often been unpredictable. I am actually not sure how I could have kept working for the past four years while being at a non-distributed company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rob Landers</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-26 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" data-attachment-id=\"3065\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2020/11/05/one-pandemic-four-countries-and-six-different-stories/rob_l/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rob_l.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"275,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rob_l\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rob_l.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rob_l.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rob_l.jpeg?resize=275%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3065\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rob_l.jpeg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rob_l.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em>Rob, you live in the Netherlands. How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected you there?</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>When the pandemic hit, my son&#8217;s school closed and I moved my home office to the ground floor to be closer to my wife and son. I&#8217;m a night owl, and worked almost eastern US time zone hours before the pandemic. I started shifting my hours and taking more breaks in my day to help out more around the house. Then my partner caught COVID-19 and I ended up taking a couple weeks off to deal with that. Our neighbors were a godsend by leaving home-cooked meals outside the house for us, dropping off medication, and running other little errands for us. After we all recovered, I moved my office back upstairs to a dedicated room, my son&#8217;s school reopened, and things went almost back to normal, except for a healthy work-life balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before COVID-19, we would travel once a month to various places around Europe. Often it would be a computer-free time to spend with family. However, after COVID-19 hit, this was pretty much impossible. From a work-life perspective, it shifted to a &#8220;little too much work&#8221; and it took a while before I realized that I needed to take a break from technology more often. Instead of traveling, we took to hiking in one of the nearby forests, often finding some awesome treasure like the Pyramide van Austerlitz.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anna Elek</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-27 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" data-attachment-id=\"3011\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/anna_e_gravatar/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"anna_e_gravatar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?resize=400%2C400&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3011\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em><em>Anna, how have you been affected by COVID-19 in Germany?</em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I returned to Germany from personal travels following our last team meetup in Cartagena, Colombia the day that most non-essential businesses in my city \u2014 Berlin \u2014 were ordered to close. Contact bans were also soon announced, and we settled in for some tough months.<br><br>I spent the first weeks of the pandemic very uncertain about how I should be feeling. At a first glance, not that much had changed in my day-to-day life: my partner and I both work in the building we live in, our work setup and daily routines are quite socially distanced by default. Nonetheless, the stress of isolation, worry about family in a different country a thousand kilometers away and general uncertainty about basically everything took its toll. I realized I was working far more than usual (even though there was absolutely no pressure on me to do so). Work was the single thing that hadn\u2019t changed at all, and I clung to that stability. I needed some time off pretty desperately \u2014 but I didn\u2019t feel like there was a point, or any justification to take vacation to do, well, nothing.<br><br>I am very grateful that my then team lead proposed and arranged for some extra time off for the entire team: a coordinated series of Fridays off helped incredibly to counter this instinct not to take a break without a good reason, to ease the loads on parents on our team and to alleviate the overwhelming nature of the whole situation. I couldn\u2019t travel or really go out much, but a few peaceful days of gaming, reading, and cooking (homemade pasta is an excellent shelter-in-place delicacy) made all the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Robert Felty</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"3013\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/rob_gravatar/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rob_gravatar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?resize=200%2C200&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3013\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em><em><em>Rob, how has COVID-19 changed your experience at work?</em></em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic really got going in the spring of 2020 I was still working at a different company, going into the office most days. At that company we had several offices throughout North America and Europe, so we were already accustomed to distributed work; it was quite rare for me to have a meeting which included only people from my local office. However, after it was announced that all the offices were closing, we definitely noticed some shifts in behavior \u2014 probably the biggest one was that people finally started turning on their cameras during conference calls. I had been pushing others to do this for years, often turning my camera on in meetings with seven or eight others, all who did not have their video on. I had thought the experience would be so awkward that others would turn their video on, but it didn\u2019t really work. Turning on video really makes people feel more connected, and also pay attention in meetings more. That was one positive effect of the switch to remote work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One big difference between Automattic and my last company was how socializing worked. Most socializing at my previous company was really only done in person \u2014 during lunch, coffee breaks, and the occasional office party. In meetings there was very little time spent on small talk. The pandemic definitely created a sense of loss of comradery in the company. At Automattic, the desire to connect with co-workers on a personal level in a remote-work environment has always been valued, and the employees have come up with many different ways to connect online \u2014 mostly through P2s (internal blogs) and Slack channels dedicated to certain topics or interest groups, like music, parenting, photography, etc. I am very happy to be working at one of the world\u2019s best remote-work companies.</p>\n",

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2020/10/20/teaching-python-to-beginners/",
    "content": "\n<p>One idea from a book that left a deep impact on me was about the surgeon\u2019s culture of teaching. Residents practice the philosophy of \u201csee one, do one, teach one,\u201d with the implication that first you watch how a procedure is done, then you do it yourself, then you can teach it to others. When you can teach a skill to others,&nbsp; you\u2019ve mastered it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In software, we don\u2019t really have this formalized apprenticeship structure&nbsp; (as I wrote about for <a href=\"https://increment.com/software-architecture/architecture-for-generations/\">the Increment)</a>, but it\u2019s still generally understood that if you can teach something you know to beginners, then you understand the concept well yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was recently invited to teach Python for Beginners at WSDS, the American Statistical Association\u2019s Conference for Data Science, and got to try out this idea in practice. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here are my slides: <a href=\"https://t.co/wVpO7XFNmG\">https://t.co/wVpO7XFNmG</a></p>&mdash; vicki (@vboykis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1311400121951756293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought it would be relatively easy to put together a slide deck that focused on a two-hour intro course, but it was, of course, much harder than I anticipated, for several reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teaching what you forgot is hard</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching&nbsp; beginners is tricky for many reasons, but the most important is that, usually, the&nbsp; teacher has forgotten what it\u2019s like to be a beginner. As I\u2019ve <a href=\"http://veekaybee.github.io/2018/03/12/installing-python-is-hard/\">written before</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>The amount of cognitive overhead needed to be a developer today results in a problem I\u2019ve seen with senior developers sometimes. They forget how much context people need to learn in order to become proficient at development. And they forget that they were beginners once, too.</p><p>Think about how complicated computers are in general, and how many layers of things need to work together, and how you need to have at least some high-level understanding of how those layers of things work, and you\u2019ll get a better understanding of what a junior developer is up against.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In creating the content for this course, for example, here are some things I forgot that beginners to Python, coming from other statistical programming packages, probably don\u2019t know:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>How to use the command line.</li><li>Whether to use Python 2 or 3.</li><li>What a Jupyter notebook is in the context of Python.</li><li>How to import libraries and what pip is.</li><li>Formatting a Python script.</li><li>How to run Python.</li><li>Where to find it on your computer.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are probably tons that I\u2019m missing.&nbsp;Because I use Python every day these things have become second nature to me through lots and lots of repetition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way I\u2019ve found to combat this is a couple of different approaches:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Go slowly and don\u2019t combine too many concepts, or introduce them piece by piece. </strong>In my course, I needed to teach&nbsp;an introduction to Python,&nbsp;how to write a Python program,&nbsp;how to use Colab notebooks, and then how to use them for data science. I broke out each piece sequentially so that each concept built on each other.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Being able to do small bits of work right away.</strong> If you\u2019re trying to teach people to use Python, the most important thing is to have students writing code as quickly as possible. As soon as people feel empowered to write a tiny piece of code, they\u2019ll want to write more right away. Theory can be hard from the get-go, especially if you\u2019re trying to explain several concepts at once.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Teach to use cases.</strong> My use case was analyzing a data set of avocado prices. I find it much easier to help beginners through a specific task and explain components as I go rather than delve into theory without any practical applications.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Explain abbreviations</strong>, or ask the class to stop you if they come across one they don\u2019t know. As experts, we use things like API and CLI all the time without thinking about it, forgetting that beginners are learning not only a new language but also the acronyms we use when we talk about it.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Teach through analogy</strong>. It\u2019s much easier to explain things in familiar terms rather than using technology-based examples when beginners are just starting out. Later on, it\u2019s possible to build on concepts.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Python is hard to install</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is a fantastic language for beginners because its syntax is&nbsp;more like reading English than other languages. However, within this ease, there is a lot of complication around setting up and installing Python, and it\u2019s always the case that, even for seasoned experts, Python environments can break.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a remote class, especially one that\u2019s only several hours long, there\u2019s not really the luxury of helping everyone set up and fix their Python environment, so I wanted to abstract all that way from beginners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked into a couple of different solutions. In the end, I chose <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">Colab notebooks</a> from Google. Ultimately, this is the easiest way to teach Python these days, I think, because it offers everyone (who has a Google account) the exact same environment and experience. They\u2019re easy to run, easy to save, and easy to share. They also have the added bonus of version control, the same kind built into Google Docs. It\u2019s another plus for them that they are similar to other products people use already. It ended up going really well. The only issue we had was of pointing to other files in Google drive as people had different folders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teaching online requires a different kind of empathy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching in-person is built a lot on understanding people\u2019s cues, looking for confusion, being able to pause, the ability to raise your hand, and ask questions. As teachers all around the world can attest, this has become pretty hard with the onset of digital learning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t mandate that my students do video so they could be comfortable, so it was really hard to see whether something made sense to people, or whether I should pause and spend more time on a given concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of things I did during the course to help:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Tell people that they\u2019re free to have their camera on or off, and to make themselves comfortable.</li><li>Get a sense for the members of the class by taking a quick poll of their backgrounds at the beginning.</li><li>Ask people to raise their hand if they don\u2019t understand something, and monitor the chat box to see if there are questions that others may have.</li><li>Reiterate the question to everyone in the class so that everyone\u2019s on the same page.</li><li>Give people my email address to reach out afterward.</li><li>Take a deep breath and talk more slowly than I would have initially so I could go over each slide in detail.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, once I navigated these issues, I think the course went well.  I\u2019m excited to use the material again for teaching more people about the wonderful data ecosystem that is Python.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>In today\u2019s post, my colleagues Greg, Anna, Anand, Anna, and Robert \u2014 who come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from fullstack software development to linguistics, hardcore math, and more \u2014 share how they came to work with data at Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Greg Ichneumon Brown</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-29 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-medium\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/gregav.jpeg?w=275\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-875\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em>Greg, you\u2019re an expert in Elasticsearch and you\u2019ve been at Automattic for over nine years. How did you come to work with this technology and at Automattic, originally?</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Automattic, I was shifting my career after 10 years as a hardware engineer. I had enjoyed designing networking and memory systems, but always had been interested in AI. I quit my job to get a Computer Science Master\u2019s degree with a focus on machine learning and natural language processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I finished my degree, I met Martin, the head of Automattic\u2019s Data Team, at a small local meetup. The Data Team only had four people at the time, and the company employed about 90 people. Initially I was intrigued by how much influence my code would have while also getting to work at a reasonably mature and successful startup. I was pretty uncertain how I would fit into a web development company though. I had hardly used PHP or JavaScript at all. But I was intrigued enough to start a trial project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was to deploy Elasticsearch to search <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">the company\u2019s ~100 P2s</a>. (P2s are websites we use to communicate within Automattic.) The project was fascinating. Because I was indexing the primary means the company used to communicate, just by doing the trial, I actually learned&nbsp; a lot about the company culture and history. The free speech and open source ethos of the company was readily apparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project involved replacing a MySQL-based search, so I was replicating WordPress data into Elasticsearch to query it. This was a longer trial project than we do now \u2014maybe 100 hours. I had used Lucene before, but Elasticsearch was only on version 0.16 and I had never used it. Everyone was fairly forgiving of my limited PHP and WordPress knowledge. In the end, the trial went pretty well. The code has been rewritten a few times, but Elasticsearch still powers our internal company search.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anna Magdalena Kedzierska</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-30 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-medium\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" data-attachment-id=\"3007\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/anna_k_gravatar/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_k_gravatar.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"anna_k_gravatar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_k_gravatar.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_k_gravatar.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_k_gravatar.png?resize=400%2C400&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3007\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_k_gravatar.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_k_gravatar.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_k_gravatar.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em><em>Anna, you\u2019re currently working on a natural language processing project. What else have you worked on in your career, and how did that take you to where you are now?</em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I came to Automattic a couple of years into my transition from science and research into industry. I have postdoctoral experience in Neuroscience, Bioinformatics, and Clinical Trials, and I had been on a path to an academic career in Algebraic Geometry and Statistics. We applied the theory behind Algebraic varieties to problems in Genome Biology and Phylogenetics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As fascinating as the world of research was, I left academia as the&nbsp; Data Science field was gaining momentum. I traveled the world exploring alternative applications of Math \u2014: from data journalism in South Africa to analyzing NGO data in Beirut and optimizing B2B marketing efforts in London \u2014 to name a few. At the same time, I was lucky to be presented with a number of opportunities to hone my programming skills e.g., through the Recurse Center in New York City&nbsp; and the Outreachy grant to work on the Node.js and V8 core. I have always enjoyed coding but this was a game changer and I was hooked (to say the least!).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I applied as a <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/software-engineer/\">Code Wrangler</a> and was matched to the <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/javascript-engineer/\">JavaScript engineer</a> position during the hiring process, which turned out to be a better fit. After two plus&nbsp; years of writing code for our admin interface <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/\">Calypso</a> and the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack plugin</a>, I moved to (or should I say \u201cwas adopted by\u201d) the Data division to work on projects that lie at the intersection of code, data and Math. Currently I\u2019m getting very close to my three-year work anniversary. I\u2019m amazed at how interesting and smooth the journey has been. I appreciate how Automattic recognizes talent and skill beyond role titles, which is really what made it possible for me to be where I am!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anand Nalya</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-31 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-medium\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" data-attachment-id=\"2588\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/06/26/reflections-from-spark-ai-summit-2018/anandnayla/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"275,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"anandnayla\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?resize=275%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2588\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em>Anand, you work as a data engineer on our data infrastructure team. How did you become interested in data engineering and what path brought you to Automattic?</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent the first five years of my career working as a full stack developer. I worked on building interfaces similar to Google Maps in the browser and an isometric game engine in ActionScript. At the same time, I was also working on the backend with technologies like Berkeley DB, Google App Engine, and Cloud Bigtable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, I was deciding whether to go deeper into one of these areas or become more of a generalist and think about starting my own company. Finally, I chose the first option and joined a company as a data engineer. For the next four years, I worked on building big data products. But because the product team was very removed from product users, I missed the validation of&nbsp; seeing people use the tools I built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, I ran across a post about <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9638211\">Data Wrangler hiring by Greg on Hacker News</a>. I applied and went through the trial, which in itself was pretty rewarding as it involved learning new stuff and interacting with my future team. Now here at Automattic, I\u2019m working both on our big data infrastructure and on internal analytics tools. It\u2019s pretty satisfying to listen to their problems and solve them. Also, the variety of problems that I get to work on is pretty amazing: I can focus on a specific area to optimize but I can also influence how our whole data infrastructure will evolve over the next few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anna Elek</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-32 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-medium\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" data-attachment-id=\"3011\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/anna_e_gravatar/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"anna_e_gravatar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?resize=400%2C400&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3011\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/anna_e_gravatar.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em>Anna, you lead our data analytics team. When did you start thinking about a career in data analytics and how did you get into this position?</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The only child in a family of mathematicians, I originally studied theoretical Economics (does that count as rebellion?), and started a Ph.D in that field as well. I eventually drifted closer to empirical Econometrics; but, as it often happens, I didn\u2019t end up completing my doctorate. A feeling that I wouldn\u2019t be fulfilled by an academic career built in me for a while, and I pivoted to a freelance business \u2014 in social media, events, and translation. I missed the clarity, the universal shared language of numbers; but enjoyed connecting the dots between people, my new faster-paced work tempo, and being much closer to the beating heart of business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few years, I found myself working for a global online travel agent in a sales/operations role \u2014 and realized I was spending a lot of my time creating reporting and finding ways to access and apply data to drive business and measure success. And I loved it. I eventually became a data analyst full-time. As someone new to data operations in tech, I spent months learning and listening \u2014 how are people using data? What are their complaints? What successes do they attribute to analytics, what do they only dream of being able to measure \u2014 and how could we work together? I was back to connecting dots in a fast-paced environment, at the root of the business, while seeking (and ever so rarely, finding) clarity in numbers. I\u2019d found my middle ground: a role, an area that I truly thrive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined Automattic about a year and a half ago, following the recommendation of a friend \u2014now colleague \u2014 of mine. I found the transparency, the dedication to open source, and distributed work very appealing, and saw working in a remote team as a fantastic way to grow as an analyst and a professional overall. I now lead the central reporting and infrastructure team I\u2019d originally joined in 2019, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited about our mission to empower business leaders at Automattic to make the right choices about the right things, with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Robert Felty</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-33 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%;\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-medium\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" data-attachment-id=\"3013\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/rob_gravatar/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rob_gravatar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?resize=400%2C400&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3013\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rob_gravatar.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%;\">\n<p><em><em>Rob, you are our newest team member and this is your second stint at Automattic. How did you get into working with data at Automattic, and how did you end up returning to work here?</em></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>My path to data was quite winding. As a kid I really liked Math and Physics, but I ended up studying German and then Linguistics. I started learning programming and web development on the side, which I eventually merged into my Linguistics research; I then gradually transitioned from Phonetics to Computational Linguistics, and along the way also picked up a bunch of statistics and machine learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been a WordPress user and developer since 2006, so I was aware of Automattic for quite some time before joining. After several years working on Natural Language Understanding at a different company, I finally decided to take my friend Greg Brown\u2019s suggestion to apply to Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During my first stint at Automattic I worked mostly on building out our Hadoop infrastructure and tools to utilize it. I learned a ton, but I missed Linguistics, which is why I left. After another four years working on Natural Language Understanding, I decided to come back to Automattic, primarily for the work culture. I have always believed in the Automattic Creed, and it truly is something that people at Automattic take to heart and practice everyday. This time around I am focusing more on our search products, which is once again in the field of Computational Linguistics, so I get to incorporate both my passion for Linguistics as well as for programming, and I get to help improve products which I care about and use myself.</p>\n",

However, as my colleague <a href=\"https://data.blog/author/dem0sh/\">Demet Dagdelen</a> and I have discovered, bootstrapping isn&#8217;t as simple as it seems.

A few months ago, I also gave a conference talk on bootstrapping, which you can watch below. <a href=\"https://yanirseroussi.com/2019/10/06/bootstrapping-the-right-way/\">The summary of the talk can be found on my blog</a>, along with links to my slides and simulation code.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZXejYz-e0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZXejYz-e0</a>\n</div></figure>\n",

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2019/08/21/gender-and-racial-bias-in-cloud-nlp-sentiment-apis/",
    "content": "\n<p>At Automattic, I work in a group that frequently uses <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/natural-language-processing/\">natural language processing</a> (NLP) &#8212; a kind of artificial intelligence (AI) &#8212; that tries to understand text. We have used NLP for suggesting domain names, to tag some support interactions, and to understand the different verticals that our customers build sites for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the course of building these tools, we have often encountered and have had to work around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.conceptnet.io/posts/2017/conceptnet-numberbatch-17-04-better-less-stereotyped-word-vectors/\">gender and racial bias</a> that gets baked into the machine learning models that we use for text analysis. This is an <a href=\"https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~msap/pdfs/sap2019risk.pdf\">acknowledged problem</a> confronting NLP and the solutions are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03862\">not simple</a>. Building fair and non-toxic NLP systems requires constant vigilance, and we are continuously auditing new platforms and models to make sure that the users of our systems are not adversely impacted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the course of these audits, I\u2019ve found evidence of gender and racial bias in the <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/sentiment.pdf\">sentiment analysis</a> services offered by Amazon (called <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-sentiment.html\">Amazon Comprehend</a>) and to a much lesser extent by Google (part of its <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/analyzing-sentiment\">Cloud Natural Language API</a>). Developers and companies wishing to use these services should at the very least conduct audits and analysis on representative data to make sure their applications are not impacted adversely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>What is sentiment analysis, why does it matter?</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sentiment analysis is a specialized kind of natural language processing. A software program scans a piece of text and then outputs an estimate of the emotion expressed in that text. The score is usually expressed on a binary scale, as either positive or negative. You can think about this in terms of a product review &#8212; on Amazon let&#8217;s say. Someone really enjoys a book. We&#8217;d expect the sentiment program to give it a high positive score. Another person trashes the same book. We&#8217;d expect the program to produce a very negative score. Let&#8217;s say that positive emotions are between 0 and 1, negative scores are between -1.0 and 0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sentiment analysis is a blunt instrument. The theories on which it is founded (that human emotion can be quantified into a limited set of fixed categories, that Western emotional norms are universal) are open for interrogation. That said, in the world of web marketing and analytics, it can at least give people on both sides of the website a rough pulse on what&#8217;s going on. (Think of consumers trying to get a sense of the product reviews, marketers and designers who are trying to improve what they are selling, listserv moderators trying to get a quick sense of when comments are getting into the bullying realm, etc.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the perspective of machine learning, the process of developing a system to score sentiment is straightforward, at least conceptually: Collect documents that you want to understand the sentiment of, get people to look at those documents and rank their sentiment, then run your machine learning algorithm to learn a scoring function that approximates the behavior of the human annotators.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Bias in sentiment</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent paper, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04508\">Examining Gender and Race Bias in Two Hundred Sentiment Analysis Systems</a>, Svetlana Kiritchenko and Saif M. Mohammad identified racial and gender bias in research grade sentiment analysis systems. Each of these systems were entered in a sentiment analysis &#8220;bake off&#8221; called <a href=\"https://aclweb.org/anthology/S18-1001\">SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets</a>. These&nbsp; systems were developed by academic AI research labs &#8212; many of which achieve state-of-the-art results in automated sentiment labeling. That is, their machine learning systems come close to scoring the documents the way that humans who labeled them did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kiritchenko and Mohammad generated more than 8,000 sentences by starting with core sentences that encompassed a range of emotions. They then varied these sentences by substituting names with high gender and racial association. (Think: common African American names vs. common European American names.) The results show a statistically significant difference in the scoring of emotion associated with African American names on the tasks of anger, fear, and sadness intensity prediction. That is, the systems were more likely to score sentences with African American names higher on these negatively associated emotions &#8212; just on the basis of name substitution. They report similar disparities in scores across gender. Over three quarters of the systems in their study mark sentences &#8220;involving one gender/race with higher intensity scores than the sentences involving the other gender/race.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>My evaluation of AWS and Google</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Kiritchenko mentioned that their work did not look at cloud systems. Among web companies, Amazon&#8217;s <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) and Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud Platform</a> (GCP) both offer sophisticated pay-per-use natural language processing systems &#8212; Amazon Comprehend in AWS (I&#8217;ll refer to it as AWS), and the Cloud Natural Language API in Google Cloud Platform (I&#8217;ll refer to it as GCP). The two companies employ a significant number of highly skilled NLP and machine learning researchers and engineers &#8212; many of whom regularly <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06818\">publish research</a> that <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html\">defines the state of the art</a> in the field. All that said:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We&#8217;d expect for AWS and GCP to have sentiment analysis that is &#8220;good enough&#8221; for most applications: that is, the sentiment scores would be in line with expectations, are consistent, and don\u2019t exhibit bias on protected groups. This in itself requires that a company has some expectations defined before deploying the service &#8212; that is, to have assembled a test set for the particular sentiment analysis case of interest with expectations on how particular phrases should be scored.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On the other hand, the two have not been without trouble regarding bias in their computer vision and AI offerings: <a href=\"http://www.aies-conference.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AIES-19_paper_223.pdf\">This study identified racial and gender bias</a> in AWS\u2019 Rekognition machine vision service, while <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12516.pdf\">this paper identified racial bias</a> in an NLP tool Google developed to moderate hate speech.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve used AWS since shortly after it was announced. After reading Kiritchenko&#8217;s and Mohammad&#8217;s article nearly a year ago, I decided to run a similar test for the GCP and AWS sentiment analysis systems using the tweets that they used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the evaluation I performed using the AWS and GCP, I found a similar pattern of gender and racial bias. I have placed code and figures associated with the analysis in<a href=\"https://github.com/charlescearl/EquityInSentiment\"> this GitHub repository</a>. This<a href=\"https://github.com/charlescearl/EquityInSentiment/blob/master/EvaluateSentimentScores.ipynb\"> Python notebook</a> pushes the corpus to AWS and GCP for analysis, while<a href=\"https://github.com/charlescearl/EquityInSentiment/blob/master/EvaluateCloudSentimentBias.ipynb\"> this notebook</a> does the analysis calculation, running statistical tests and creating <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/home/notched-box-plots\">notched box plots</a> (giving us a visual of where the medians for the different score distributions lie) shown below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A word on statistical testing here. To determine if there is some difference in the way the systems are scoring sentences with African American names vs. those with European names; or sentences that use female-gendered names vs male-gendered ones, we need to make a hypothesis that can be accepted or rejected based on the evidence of scores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our hypothesis in this case is that the systems will score those sets of sentences the same &#8212; that there is no inherent bias in the systems with respect to gender or race. We then ask the question, in a world where the systems are unbiased, how surprising is it that a particular difference in scores occurred? Statistical hypothesis tests give us a <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/p-values-explained-by-data-scientist-f40a746cfc8\">p-value</a>, which I\u2019ve included with the box plots below. P-values are always between 0 and 1. The larger the p-value, the more likely it is that the hypothesis holds &#8212; we should be more trusting in our sentiment analysis. The smaller the p-value, the more our hypothesis is thrown into doubt. For example, having a p-value of 0.05 means that there is only a 5% chance that we would observe this difference in scores with an unbiased system. We usually throw out the hypothesis in this case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these analyses, I\u2019ve used a paired <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test\">Wilcoxon signed-rank test</a>, used when you are testing data that can be paired &#8212; in this case female-male and African American-European name pairs on the same sentence template.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/null.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see both visually from the notches (the location of the median), and from the p-values, there is evidence of bias in the AWS sentiment analysis system. It\u2019s not scoring sentences involving African American names the same as actors with European names. The GCP system looks good from this analysis, but there are some quirks that I will delve into below. The AWS sentiment analysis service performs worse than the GCP service with respect to fair analysis of sentences involving African American affiliated names. <img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/null-1.png?resize=624%2C301&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"301\"><br>\nAWS and GCP sentiment analysis APIs both show evidence of gender bias, AWS more so in having p-values that are all much less than 0.05 (i.e., the test is saying that there is virtually no chance of seeing these differences if the test were unbiased).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the difference in means, the differences are certainly more pronounced for <i>anger</i> in both cases &#8212; both ranking sentences involving males and European-named males to be negative. It is not possible to say why the systems are scoring this way, or to even impute what kind of biases might be the basis, we can just say that the systems are scoring a particular group differently, and we should expect that there be no difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we look at individual sentences, the difference across gender and race is even more pronounced. The figure below compares the AWS sentiment scores on a set of example sentences that express fear and anger respectively. Along the top row, I compare scores on the exact sentence template where the placeholder SOMEONE is replaced by a name or pronoun of a different (binary) gender. The distribution of scores where a female name or pronoun is substituted for SOMEONE is shown along the top, and scores where a male name or pronoun is used are shown along the bottom. Along the second row, we compare the same sentence with SOMEONE replaced by a first name that has a racial association &#8212; the sentiment score distribution for African-American associated names across the top and distribution for European associated names along the bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/null-2.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For each of these specific cases, the difference in score distribution is significant &#8212; the test p-value is saying that there is a <i>less than .1% chance</i> that these differences would occur in a system that is unbiased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GCP on the other hand, for a lot of the cases just seems to clamp everything to the same value.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/null-3.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, <b>all </b>of the sentences following the template are clamped to the same value of 0.0. That seems a bit extreme. In fact for the words \u201cvexing,\u201d \u201coutrageous,\u201d \u201cserious,\u201d and \u201cfunny,\u201d the sentiment for the sentence template \u201cSOMEONE found himself/herself in a/an WORD situation\u201d are all 0. That doesn\u2019t seem to inspire much confidence either. This could be simply because the GCP algorithm seems to assign a fixed score unless the sentence is longer, or restricts deeper analysis to particular sentence structures and words. For example, substituting the word \u201cgloomy\u201d in the \u201cSOMEONE found himself/herself in a/an WORD situation\u201d gives non-zero scoring with significant (p &lt;&lt; 0.05) differences across race and gender. The capabilities of the GCP service are more sophisticated, offering the user the ability to score the sentiment of entities within a sentence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>My recommendations: test before you leap</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My takeaways are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The AWS Sentiment analysis definitively displays a degree of gender bias. There are indications that it also scores sentences in which the subjects have African American names differently than subjects with English language names that are European (Anglo Saxon) in origin. Users of the AWS sentiment analysis would be advised to carefully evaluate test corpuses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The GCP Sentiment analysis service seems to be less sensitive to the race or gender of participants. GCP in some instances clamps the score to a fixed value depending upon emotion word and sentence structure. I haven\u2019t done enough analysis to know why or how. Whether to use the entity-based sentiment or the standard whole-sentence analysis seems to depend upon the structure of the corpus being evaluated. Users should conduct test evaluations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is difficult to understand the impact of the gender and racial disparities on your particular service without conducting a detailed evaluation. Let&#8217;s say that you make skin care products for men and women. Understanding the fine differences of how women react to a new line is important, and you&#8217;d want to take account of the possible ways that the sentiment analysis system is clouding the responses of your women customers. On the other hand, the disparities in a particular line might be so small as not to matter &#8212; you may just want a rough estimate. Either way, you need to know.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This said, for now I would go with GCP in that it seems to perform \u201cless bad\u201d &#8212; performing biased scoring less often. Better yet, annotate and train a model based upon your own data for critical applications. Analysis of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10561.pdf\">newly developed models</a> indicates that they may be less prone to gender, racial, and intersectional bias. It is likely that Google\u2019s<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/automl/docs/\"> Cloud AutoML Natural Language</a> may use these models, but again you will have to bring you own data.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you are an AWS customer, asking them for more transparency and for modification of the service would be another step forward. Despite the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/technology/amazon-facial-recognition-technology.html\">recent issues with the Rekognition</a> face ID service, I&#8217;ve found AWS technical support to be responsive.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>But to wrap it up, we could ask &#8220;Who cares?&#8221; Automated sentiment analysis &#8212; particularly the cloud-based services &#8212; are being folded into more consumer facing pipelines. Comment moderation is one application, but I mentioned earlier the May 2019 paper &#8220;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12516\">Racial Bias in Hate Speech and Abusive Language Detection Datasets</a>&#8221; that identified racial bias in Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.perspectiveapi.com/\">https://www.perspectiveapi.com</a> comment moderation tool. Customer interaction analysis as well as HR oriented feedback tools are other critical applications. Before launching a pipeline into production, please do yourself and your customers a service by conducting an audit. And transparency also will help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it would be interesting to expand upon Kiritchenko and Mohammad\u2019s methodology by looking at the impact on scoring of <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/topics/genealogy/2010surnames/surnames.pdf\">African-American and ethnicity associated surnames</a>. In my analysis, I noted that GCP sentiment appeared to differentiate sentiment better on longer passages. It would be interesting to conduct the same analysis on passages having two to five sentences. It would be interesting to do a cluster analysis to understand better instances where the scoring confounds contrasting words (e.g., similar to GCP not differentiating \u201cserious situation\u201d from \u201chilarious situation.\u201d)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Removing evidence of gender or race from sentences might help in some cases. But what if you&#8217;re trying to score book reviews of a work with female-gendered characters, or of movies like <i>Black Panther</i>? What about if understanding the role that gender plays in your application is important? There is recent work on de-biasing of NLP algorithms [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07187\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07187</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520\"> https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520</a>] but these methods require that you have access to the internals of the algorithm to properly account for the bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give some further empirical support to my claim that the best option is to measure bias, Gonan and Goldberg argue that de-biasing efforts are more akin to putting<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03862\"> Lipstick on a Pig</a>. They argue that since the clues for gender and race based bias are pervasive in text, one can only <i>measure</i> it rather <i>neutralize</i> it. Understand where and how your AI is biased, and build your application accordingly.</p>\n",

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2019/07/24/christo-wilson-discusses-the-ethics-of-online-behavioral-experiments/",
    "content": "\n<p>On May 1 of 2019, <a href=\"https://cbw.sh/\">Dr. Christo Wilson</a>&nbsp;gave a talk on his investigation into&nbsp;<i>online behavioral experiments</i>. The talk was based on a piper entitled&nbsp;<em>Who&#8217;s the Guinea Pig? Investigating Online A/B/n Tests in-the-Wild,&nbsp;</em>which he and his students gave at the <a href=\"https://fatconference.org/2019/program.html\">2019 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency</a> in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online behavioral experiments (OBEs) are studies (aka <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B/n tests</a>) that people conduct on websites to gain insight into their users&#8217; preferences. Users typically aren&#8217;t asked for consent and these studies are typically benign. Typically an OBE will explore questions such as whether changing the background color influences how the user interacts with the site or whether the user is more likely to read an article if the font is slightly larger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, these studies cross ethical boundaries. For example, Facebook conducted an <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1747016115599568\">ethically problematic experiment</a> designed to <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788\">manipulate the emotional state of its users</a>. Dr Wilson is concerned about whether we (as users of online services and as practitioners) need to adopt more stringent ethical standards for these experiments. To probe this question, he and his group took a close look at OBEs deployed using a popular platform called <a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com/\">Optimizely.</a>&nbsp; In the talk, he went into detail on how Optimizely works, presents data on how sites typically use it, and discussed some possible guidelines for performing online experiments ethically. The main takeaway is to be transparent and up front with users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, I\u2019ve sectioned the talk video into smaller segments and included my notes and insights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introduction</h1>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-GVbeeYaW-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/GVbeeYaW?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Christo Wilson &#8212;\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:c.wilson@northeastern.edu\">c.wilson@northeastern.edu</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bowlinearl\">@bowlinearl</a> &#8212; is an Associate Professor at the College of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern University.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background on Online Behavioral Experiments</h1>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-tKzjWoMi-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/tKzjWoMi?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Summary:</strong>\u00a0Websites are constantly being adjusted to deliver the best user experience &#8212; or to optimize some monetary objective. Many sites run classic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_subject_research\">human subject experiments</a> to guide this optimization, but websites usually guard this process. In medicine and in the social sciences, these experiments are carefully monitored to prevent abuse. Can we apply the same standards to websites?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insights:\u00a0</strong>Informed consent is an important principle that could be easily adopted &#8211;even automated. Additionally third parties versed in ethics could provide independent auditing of experimental practices.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Using Optimizely to Study OBEs</h1>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-XRjVotL2-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/XRjVotL2?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Summary:</strong>\u00a0In this section of the talk, Wilson described Optimizely, the platform that his group used to take a closer look at some live online experiments. Optimizely&#8217;s API enabled their team to gather basic statistics on experiments, including duration, audience segmentation, and device types involved. That is, when you crawl a site that is running an Optimizely test, you can grab a JSON file with details of the experiments running on the site. In all, they ended up doing an audit of 575 websites for three months.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insights:\u00a0</strong>I thought it was a clever observation to use the configuration file in this way. At least for Optimizely sites, it also gives users an indication of whether they are involved in an experiment, and this might be a path that would allow for users to ask for more transparency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Analysis</h1>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-n8Dgff1I-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/n8Dgff1I?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Summary:\u00a0</strong>Most sites in their survey didn&#8217;t seem to use the full capabilities of Optimizely &#8212; most did little or no audience segmentation. <em>The New York Times</em>, AirAsia, and CREDO Mobile were among the sites running the most sophisticated experiments. Most of the sites have only two variations per experiment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insights:\u00a0</strong>It is was odd to see such a low use of deep segmentation. It may also be, as Dr. Wilson pointed out, that sophisticated experiments are being conducted in internal systems, or with Google Optimize.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Studies &#8212; Price Discrimination and NY Times</h1>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-pzIW4q0x-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/pzIW4q0x?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Summary:\u00a0</strong>This segment of the talk presents two case studies. The first is <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_discrimination.asp\">price discrimination</a>: sites trying to adapt prices to what the customer is willing to pay based on guesses about the audience segment. The API can&#8217;t provide deep insight into how prices were being set. This is potentially concerning but there is no data to probe. The other case is the structure of news headlines at <em>The New York Times</em>. &#8220;Clickier&#8221; headlines seem to do better revenue-wise, which may conflict with journalistic ethics and standards.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insights:\u00a0</strong>Wilson makes a good point 13 minutes into this section, which is that <strong>subtle changes, produced by the headline optimization could change completely the impression of the news reported and even further, change how different audience segments view the same event.</strong> In light of concerns about deepfakes, fake news, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.connexionfrance.com/Mag/Language/Say-infox-not-fake-news\">infox</a>, this is certainly something to pay attention to.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limitations and Ethics</h1>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-c1vozKei-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/c1vozKei?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Summary:\u00a0</strong>There are a lot of gaps in getting deeper understanding of the audiences involved in the tests that were observed, and there are many testing platforms that are completely opaque. <strong>The encouraging thing is that in this sample, they uncovered no flagrant ethical violations.</strong> However, there is no disclosure of tests &#8212; even deep inside the terms of service statements. The <a href=\"https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/4/senators-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-ban-manipulative-dark-patterns\">DETOUR</a> act &#8212; just now a proposal introduced in April by Senators Mark Warner and Deb Fischer &#8212; could provide a starting point to regulate online testing. It seeks to ban online experiments\u00a0 designed to manipulate users and to set standards for informed consent.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insights:\u00a0</strong>Optimizely and other providers should probably provide up-front ethics training for setting up experiments, not as an afterthought. A quick video search of &#8220;ethics in a/b testing&#8221; turned up empty. There is an opportunity for a concerted effort across vendors for ethics training and audits that could be a vital component in securing consumer confidence and safety.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions and wrap up</h1>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-JP1X28n1-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/JP1X28n1?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Summary: </strong>Dr. Wilson was asked if there was a good litmus test for assessing the ethics of an experiment. He suggested to begin by asking yourself whether users would become angry if it were to be revealed that they had unknowingly participated in the study. He suggested also to think through whether the test might exclude or treat unfairly a particular audience, especially members of a protected class. Assembling a trusted group of reviewers for experimental design, especially for the questionable cases might be a good way to start.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insights:</strong>I think there&#8217;s an opportunity to lead developing standards for experimental design, formal review processes, and overall transparency. This <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257\">Udacity course</a> &#8212; prepared by data scientists at Google &#8212; gives a short lesson on ethics in A/B testing. Again, it provides just an introduction to some of the issues. Given the legislative (e.g., DETOUR act) pressures, especially likely as the U.S. election nears, it looks like an ideal opening for practitioners to take the lead and develop standards amongst themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Since then, we have returned to the Data division and formed a new team called Marketing Science&nbsp;<strong>with the</strong> <strong>mission to use science to empower marketing</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Marketing Science anyway?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite description so far comes from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/facebookcareers/videos/296529144406713/\">Marketing Science team at Facebook</a>: <strong>Marketing Science transforms marketing efforts so that they are grounded in data and science.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My emphasis on that definition would be on the word&nbsp;<em>transforms</em>. Integrating data and scientific methods into decision making processes is not a straight forward or easy task. Everyone wants data and &#8220;truths&#8221; they can trust but short-term business goals and already established methods do not necessarily align with the long-term efforts required to get there. The path to making existing efforts grounded in data and science takes a lot of time and effort spent on&nbsp;<strong>making changes</strong> in objectives, tooling, established practices, and culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter alignnone size-full wp-image-2860\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"656\" height=\"414\" data-attachment-id=\"2860\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/10/using-ml-for-campaign-optimization-our-journey-to-marketing-science-at-automattic/screen-shot-2019-05-30-at-13-01-27/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/screen-shot-2019-05-30-at-13.01.27-e1559214295107.png?fit=656%2C414&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"656,414\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-30 at 13.01.27\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&#8220;what we need more of is science&#8221;: Tagline for data scientists at Automattic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/screen-shot-2019-05-30-at-13.01.27-e1559214295107.png?fit=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/screen-shot-2019-05-30-at-13.01.27-e1559214295107.png?fit=656%2C414&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/screen-shot-2019-05-30-at-13.01.27-e1559214295107.png?resize=656%2C414&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-30 at 13.01.27\" class=\"wp-image-2860\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/screen-shot-2019-05-30-at-13.01.27-e1559214295107.png?w=656&amp;ssl=1 656w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/screen-shot-2019-05-30-at-13.01.27-e1559214295107.png?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">&#8220;what we need more of is science&#8221;: Tagline for data scientists at Automattic.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A case study from Marketing Science: Optimizing discount campaigns via ML</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we work to scale our tooling and align more closely with our stakeholders, we also run experiments to see the <strong>effect</strong> of different marketing interventions, analyze how they could be more <strong>successful</strong>, and use insights to improve <strong>results</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of our previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.blog/2019/01/15/how-to-increase-retention-and-revenue-in-1000-nontrivial-steps/\">RR++: Increase Retention and Revenue</a>&nbsp;project, we devised a small intervention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The goal:</strong> Increase retention of and revenue from our paid plan users while making sure we only reach out to those users who would like to receive the email offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Method:</strong> Discount campaign via emails to Day 30 users.

However, blindly emailing customers frequently would&nbsp;<strong>lose us loyalty and subscribers</strong>. Automattic&#8217;s Marketing team takes great care to &#8220;<a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/\">build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers</a>.&#8221;&nbsp; This means that while the team would like to make sure that customers are informed and aware of offers, we also try and make sure that we do not email people too often.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>90 percent of UK consumers have unsubscribed from communications from retailers in the past 12 months, with nearly half saying this is because they received too many messages from brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<span class=\"title--only\"><a href=\"https://www.growthbusiness.co.uk/spray-pray-email-marketing-tactics-fail-9-10-customers-2551052/\">Why \u2018spray and pray\u2019 email marketing tactics fail to retain customers</a></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, when you are <strong>emailing users with a discount offer</strong>, and someone who would take you up on it even at full price receives it and buys your product at a discounted price, you are <strong>losing revenue</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how marketing science and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_modelling\">uplift modelling</a> <a href=\"http://scientificmarketer.com/2007/02/fundamental-campaign-segmentation.html\">literature</a> defines the four important segments of customer behavior:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The customers who will buy regardless of whether you send them an offer or not: <strong>the sure things.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>The customers who will refuse to buy with or without the offer. They have moved on! They are <strong>the lost causes.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>The customers who will actually react negatively to receiving an offer. They would have renewed a subscription or bought a product had you not the audacity to email them about it. We must let<strong> sleeping dogs </strong>lie.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>persuadables</strong> &#8212; the holy grail of marketing segmentation, those users who are on the fence.

This leaves you with only one interesting group to treat: The persuadables. These are the customers that show an increased propensity to buy if they are treated with a marketing activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/touchpoints-ai/uplift-modelling-is-hard-but-worth-it-37a9e9dc5015\">Source: Uplift modelling is hard \u2014 but worth it</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Define success, measure effect, and increase impact</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Defining success</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, data should be able to help&nbsp;<strong>identify persuadables: users who will only buy if they receive a discount</strong>. We <strong>defined success</strong>&nbsp;as being able to identify these users and make our campaign for increasing retention and revenue as efficient as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An important thing to mention here is that our model predicts whether users will churn or not. It does not predict whether they will respond to the marketing effort or not. The true value of uplift modeling comes from being able to build models based on a user&#8217;s likelihood to churn or purchase <em>as a response to a marketing campaign</em>. We will write about our work on uplift modeling in upcoming installments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But our hypothesis is that by <strong>segmenting users by their likelihood to churn </strong>and setting up well-designed experiments, we will be able to find those that would take us up on our offer even without a discount and <strong>exclude them from our targeting&nbsp;</strong>thus increasing <strong>incremental revenue per user</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Measuring effect</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is to devise <strong>an experiment to measure success</strong>. Causal inference either via controlled or natural experiments is probably the single most important and highly used tool for a marketing scientist. Experimental design is not always intuitive and it takes domain knowledge and a lot of deliberate thinking to set up A/B tests that actually answer the right questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our experiment setup: Segments</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, we have segments provided by our churn model. The churn model offers raw scores based on a user&#8217;s likelihood to churn and we can bucket these scores into quantiles to come up with segments. For example, the top 25% of users most likely to churn; the bottom 25%, which would be users least likely to churn..etc. If you have more users, you may want to bucket your users&#8217; scores into deciles, instead, to get a more granular view.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"932\" height=\"245\" data-attachment-id=\"2863\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/10/using-ml-for-campaign-optimization-our-journey-to-marketing-science-at-automattic/segments/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segments.jpg?fit=932%2C245&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"932,245\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"segments\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segments.jpg?fit=300%2C79&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segments.jpg?fit=932%2C245&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segments.jpg?resize=932%2C245&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"segments.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-2863\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segments.jpg?w=932&amp;ssl=1 932w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segments.jpg?resize=300%2C79&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segments.jpg?resize=768%2C202&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We end up with four, non-overlapping segments to analyze, plus an overall segment which includes everyone so that we can see the impact of segmentation. (Maybe the churn scores provide sub-optimal segments and it&#8217;s better to send our offer to everyone without doing any segmentation. We&#8217;ll find out soon.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For each of the segments, we put half the users in the control group and half in the test group. We will then see how the offer affects users differently based on which segment they are in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our experiment setup: test vs. control treatments</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important aspect of experimental design is to <strong>determine an appropriate control group treatment</strong> for what we are trying to test. Traditionally, the A/B tests around discount campaigns <strong>send half the users an email with a discount</strong>. The <strong>other half do not receive anything</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this would be the wrong setup since we are interested in the<strong> impact of the discount itself</strong>. If the control group did not receive anything at all, we would still not understand whether our customers made a purchase because there was a discount or simply because they got nudged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why for this experiment we came up with two emails:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Test email</strong>: An offer for one of our plans along <strong>with a discount code</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Control email</strong>: An offer for the same plan <strong>without the discount code</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our experiment setup: Metrics</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A note on <strong>incrementality</strong>: Let&#8217;s say you run a campaign that sends an email to 100 users and no email at all to a similar set of 100 users. You find that those that received an email spent $1,000 USD. So your <em>net</em> revenue is $1,000 USD for your campaign. Users not receiving the offer, however, spent $1,200 USD which means that you actually lost revenue by sending the email since your <em>incremental</em> revenue is -$200 USD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an industry-wide standard to have net revenue as opposed to <em>incremental</em> revenue as one of the higher-level metrics. This makes sense in some scenarios. However, I have strong advice for every marketer in charge of campaigns: <strong>never even glimpse at net revenue numbers</strong> when evaluating campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to analyzing the results, we relied on <em>incremental</em> average revenue per user (ARPU)&nbsp; as our primary test metric for each of the segments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then multiply the ARPU by the number of eligible users in each segment so we get <strong>a crude estimate of the overall <em>incremental</em> revenue</strong> we would get on a monthly basis if we rolled the discount campaign out to the given segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if the 95% confidence interval for the incremental ARPU for a segment is between $0.3 USD and $0.5 USD and we have 1,000 users in that segment, then we would expect that segment to bring in $300 USD &#8211; $500 USD in incremental revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that, for example, Quantile 4 (the top 25% of users most likely to churn) has only one-fourth of all users. It is a smaller segment than the no-segments group which has all the users. Which means that in certain cases you may find that one segment performs better in terms of ARPU but if that segment has very few users, then it may not be the segment that makes the most sense to target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Experiment results</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We first looked at this as if it were a simple test, so we looked at everyone without any segmentation. We found that the ARPU for the test was negative with 95% confidence intervals showing non-statistically significant results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, the test would be considered unsuccessful and stop here as the offer is potentially losing money. However, the segmentation made possible by the churn likelihood scores depicted a different picture. We found that not only is the offer successful for those that are deemed as most likely to churn, but only targeting this group also makes this campaign one of our most efficient ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are able to maximize incremental revenue by only emailing <em>half</em> of our eligible users. Emailing all of them would potentially lose us money.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is in line with our stated goal of increasing retention rates and revenue by only emailing those users who would potentially like to hear from us as opposed to targeting (and annoying) every possible customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\"

class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We would not have been able to see this had we kept the control group as an absolute holdout and not sent them an email without a discount.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We can see that <strong>there are users here who respond really well to an email without a discount</strong> so we are potentially losing money by giving them a discount.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Those that are<strong> less likely to churn are also not responding well to the discount</strong>, they may be<strong> just as likely to take us up on our simple offer</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The one combination of segments where we see a\u00a0<strong>statistically significant increase in revenue</strong> by <strong>offering a discount is the top 2 segments of users most likely to churn</strong>.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>These users <strong>only purchase if offered a discount</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Here, neither Quantile 3 nor Quantile 4 showed statistically significant results <em>individually</em> but this is why it makes sense to look at segments that make sense to combine.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We <strong>increase</strong> incremental revenue of the campaign while <strong>emailing only half of our eligible customers</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>As mentioned, if we were to look at net revenue, we would make the absolute wrong decision.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If we rely on net revenue we could find that <strong>even campaigns that are demonstrably losing money can report very high net revenue numbers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Increasing impact</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we have a successful A/B test result that is rooted in careful experimental design, we are ready to roll out the campaign. This campaign is constantly being monitored by leaving out a small group to make sure that it performs as well in the wild as it did during the testing phase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any such test or predictive model will only be as useful as the marketing domain expertise and collaboration that powers it. The data or model scores rely on strong marketing strategies and continually testing carefully crafted offers to strengthen them. The experiment was also a good way to build and strengthen relationships between our data-driven marketers and data scientists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Future impact comes from being able to iterate on results. This means that we can now work even more closely with our marketing stakeholders to widen our net and start playing around with <em>a family of offers</em> and machine learning models that can pick the right offer for each user. While Quantiles 1 and 2 in our small experiment may not have been the right target group for a discount offer, they may turn out to respond well to different campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next installments on pipe, we will look into larger campaigns; discuss our <strong>secondary test metrics</strong>, show how likelihood scores can end up providing <strong>better</strong> <strong>segments for campaign optimization than heuristics-based options</strong> (e.g., &#8220;users that added an item to their cart,&#8221; &#8220;users that logged in in the past N days,&#8221;..etc.), and how <strong>machine learning can help pick which of many different offers to send to each user</strong>&nbsp;&#8212; or maybe no offer at all &#8212; without overwhelming them.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>We had the honor of hosting <a href=\"https://dataorigami.net/\">Cameron Davidson-Pilon</a> for an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session. Among other things, Cam is known for writing the <a href=\"http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/\">Probabilistic Programming &amp; Bayesian Methods for Hackers book</a> and for the <a href=\"https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">lifelines</a> and <a href=\"https://lifetimes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">lifetimes</a> Python packages, which implement algorithms for survival analysis and customer lifetime value estimation, respectively. He recently left Shopify where he was a Director of Data Science to pursue professional development toward a potential career change. This post presents some highlights and clips from our conversation.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-LlAJVcwe-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/LlAJVcwe?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What strategies do you find effective for improving adoption of good data practices across the organization?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Telling stakeholders about negative causal inference examples and how going with gut feeling can be wrong. One example is <a href=\"http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/BS704-EP713_Confounding-EM/BS704-EP713_Confounding-EM2.html\">birth order and probability of Down syndrome</a>. They are positively correlated, so people may wrongly infer that it is best not to have more than 1-3 children. However, when taking maternal age into account, the causal relationship evaporates. This gets people thinking about confounding variables and understanding why simply looking at 2D charts that ignore the full causal structure is problematic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, it&#8217;s not enough to say that correlation isn&#8217;t causation. As data scientists, we should also provide examples where assuming causation from correlation fails, and show stakeholders how to model causal relationships with DAGs (directed acyclic graphs). Every data scientist should read the <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/\">Causal Inference book by Hern\u00e1n and Robins</a>, and communicate its contents to stakeholders. It&#8217;s often the stakeholders that can draw the best DAGs because they&#8217;re the domain experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid a negative reaction, I wouldn&#8217;t present such findings as something that specific stakeholders do wrong. Instead, highlight cases where the entire scientific community got something wrong, or where data scientists made mistakes that we learned from.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What techniques and tools do you recommend for causal inference?</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/\">The CausalImpact package</a> for one-off events that can&#8217;t be A/B tested. The visualizations produced by the package tell a very good story that&#8217;s accessible to stakeholders.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/GeoexperimentsResearch\">The GeoexperimentsResearch package</a> is useful for A/B testing marketing campaigns across regions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>As noted, <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/\">the Causal Inference book</a> should be read by all data scientists. The <a href=\"https://github.com/pzivich/zEpid\">zEpid package</a> provides Python implementations of some of the algorithms from the book.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-aUap6Dlm-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/aUap6Dlm?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you share some thoughts on the organizational structure of data teams?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This depends on the company. At Shopify we had one team per business area (e.g., marketing, finance), which worked well. The data organization was strongly influenced by the organization of the company as a whole, as the focus was on engineering, product, and design. Within each group, we maintained separate ETL (extract-transform-load) flows, datasets, and stakeholder relationships, but APIs were well-documented and discoverable so that data scientists from the entire company could use data regardless of their team and domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as with any company, areas of expertise aren&#8217;t evenly distributed across teams. For example, my teams were focused on reporting and ETL, whereas product-facing teams were focused more on machine learning. Due to hype cycles, many people wanted to do more machine learning work, but I highlighted causal inference as a cool new area that is worth specializing in. This is especially worthwhile as there are fewer causal inference specialists than machine learning specialists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cultivated a community of data experts across the domain-focused teams by implementing consistent APIs for accessing data. We also started a data nomenclature movement, enforced rules around dataset creation and storage, and invested in data discovery. This included the creation of metadata for each dataset, and showing the lineage and dependencies of the data. In addition to helping people work across teams, it helped with on-boarding new hires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn&#8217;t easy to implement in existing teams with legacy constraints, but when new teams were established, it was a good opportunity to create new APIs and a warehouse layout that implemented the lessons we&#8217;ve learned over the years. Such teams could get everything right from day one, e.g., having tests and regex constraints on column names. This is similar to charter cities, where a state creates a brand new city with all the best infrastructure and principles. Like with real cities with a physical infrastructure, it&#8217;s hard to bring all the best practices to existing teams, as changing infrastructure like table schemas requires a lot of effort. It\u2019s easier to build things correctly when projects are new, and use this \u201ccharter data warehouse\u201d approach to spread best practices across the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What can data science teams do to become more successful?</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Talk to your stakeholders a lot to ensure you have a good grasp of their wants and needs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do the legwork of basic descriptive stats (analytics, reporting, and dashboards) to get a good idea what the client teams are doing. This is also important for building trust between the data team and stakeholders. Once trust is established, stakeholders may ask riskier (and more interesting) questions around machine learning and causal inference.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On the topic of trust, it is important to ship by the deadlines the team has committed to, and continuously inform stakeholders of any delays.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is worth looking beyond reporting into causal inference questions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In general, strive to save your clients time and money, which are always in short supply.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-AtfaBao2-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/AtfaBao2?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you been up to since leaving Shopify? What&#8217;s next for you?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I worked a lot on lifetimes and lifelines. That took a few months. I was never really proud of the packages, but now I think they&#8217;re in a very good spot. I recently posted on <a href=\"https://dataorigami.net/blogs/napkin-folding/evolution-of-lifelines-over-the-past-few-months\">the evolution of lifelines over the past few months</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m thinking of a change in the domain I&#8217;m working in. I\u2019m going back to school to take chemistry and biology courses. I like the idea of cellular agriculture (lab-grown meat), as it&#8217;s good for the environment and for animal welfare. I may do a master\u2019s degree in food science or microbiology. There&#8217;s not much happening in Canada in this field, and I want to change it, as there is a good opportunity to do more here. This may or may not include making <a href=\"http://remotestorage.blogspot.com/2010/07/margaret-atwoods-chickienobs.html\">Margaret Atwood\u2019s ChickieNobs</a> a reality.</p>\n",

(I\u2019m currently on my 3rd play through of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>.) I read an article about <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18311287/ai-upscaling-algorithms-video-games-mods-modding-esrgan-gigapixel\">AI upscaling</a>, a process that transforms low resolution game graphics to high resolution, making them look more modern. Using a GAN trained on high and low resolution versions of the same photo, AI upscaling allows for much better results than commonly used nearest neighbor algorithms. With AI upscaling tools more widely available, many classic games are getting a new look. But, it\u2019s no quick fix. Even with the aid of these tools, it still takes dozens of hours to upscale a game. I guess it\u2019ll be a while before my favorite Play Station 1 game, <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullmonkeys\"><em>Skullmonkeys</em></a>, looks as good as <em>BOTW</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Boris Gorelik</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-716\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913?needAccess=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noreferrer\">Moving to a World Beyond \u201cp &lt; 0.05\u201d</a></em> is an opinion article written by three scientists that call for abandoning significance tests in science.

    "content": "\n<p>Like any company, Automattic is constantly on a journey to get better: sometimes we have the good fortune of finding improvement in leaps and bounds, but most of the time, we move slowly, we make small changes, finding iterative wins and moving down the to-do list. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think probably this is how most progress happens: the same way Hemingway described going broke \u2014 gradually, then suddenly. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the big-picture initiatives we\u2019re undertaking at the moment is the pursuit of greater insights from our mountains of data. We\u2019re not alone in this pursuit, it\u2019s a common objective among software companies especially, and as such there are heaps of third party applications and consultants available to help you along your way: we chose a tool called <a href=\"https://looker.com/learn/recorded-demo?utm_source=wordpress_com_data_blog\">Looker</a>, for reasons I go into <a href=\"https://s12k.com/2019/02/18/the-pitch-for-looker-at-automattic/\">here</a>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve had the good fortune of bringing back a former Automattician <a href=\"https://mattmazur.com/\">Matt Mazur</a> in a consulting role to help us get our Looker instance going, along with of course Looker\u2019s professional services organization. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with these resources, there\u2019s always more to learn. Especially when it comes to reporting, an organization\u2019s output will depend on a robust and trustworthy pipeline: if your reports proudly display a lovely scatterplot with totally wrong underlying data points due to an error upstream, that\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s a real problem! <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I set forth from my home in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, to join my first ever <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-XwKEpidf/\">Looker NYC Meetup</a> \u2014 which was luckily on the topic of Data Engineering and infrastructure, my exact curiosity. A quick drive to Poughkeepsie and a light rail ride into Manhattan, and I was in the heart of it. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evening\u2019s panel was made up of some serious expertise: Jonathan Lenaghan, Director of Engineering at <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/\">Datadog</a>, Sean McIntyre, Lead Data Engineer at <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/\">Warby Parker</a>, Lenny Fishler, the Data Strategy Manager at <a href=\"https://www.braze.com/\">Braze</a>, and Dylan Baker a hired gun freelance analyst with <a href=\"https://dbanalytics.co/\">DBAnalytics</a>. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was your classic panel discussion: questions and answers, some from the moderator <a href=\"https://www.namely.com/\">Namely\u2019s</a>, and some excellent discussion of divergent approaches to similar problems. It was satisfying and interesting to see the different-but-still-successful tactics different members of the panel took to solving their largely parallel data pipeline issues. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One topic that arose more than once was the evolving nature of data engineering: Dylan envisioned a future where entire data pipelines could be engaged without writing a line of Python, leveraging instead third party services like Five Tran and business intelligence tools like Looker. All of the folks present agreed that outsourcing data engineering tasks to outside platforms was a big part of their pipeline. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is interesting as it can be seen as an industry wide shift in response to the dearth of experienced data engineers &#8211; since many companies are unable to hire the in-house resources they might prefer, they have to find other ways to fulfill their pipeline needs, and that\u2019s where these vendors step in.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also worth mentioning is the idea of Looker-as-prototype: Looker puts a tremendous amount of data transformation power in the hands of the data analyst or LookML developer, but leveraging that power can leave the resulting data difficult for other parts of the organization to access. Using Looker to try out different transformations before pushing them upstream to earlier ETL processes was a common and unexpected use case. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole experience was such a reminder that problems that seem so imminent and novel are rarely as unique as they may appear: finding and leveraging a community of practice can totally change your perspective. Even one evening in a room of bright, thoughtful folks working hard on the same problems that we are was both encouraging and validating. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I came home on the late train excited to get back to work: whatever you\u2019re working on, if you find that you\u2019re feeling stuck, let me offer you this real-life cheat code: find a way to get yourself surrounded by like-minded folks in your community of practice. Have a coffee, have a beer, and have yourself a chat. </p>\n",

Over the last year or so, we&#8217;ve been actively focusing on nurturing a healthy data culture here at A8c. This video has been making the rounds again lately, because it&#8217;s such a great example of the level of commitment this takes from the company as a whole, and its rewards. Andrea also highlights that this is an ongoing effort, as we are always striving for better products and more efficient processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Demet Dagdelen</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/demet.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/demet.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-718\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karen Hao&#8217;s article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613063/ai-ethics-mit-college-of-computing-tech-humanities/\" rel=\"nofollow\">There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201ctech person\u201d in the age of AI</a>,&#8221; succinctly goes through all the great arguments for introducing a much more coupled and stronger interaction between tech and the humanities. As someone with a background in both natural sciences and humanities &#8212; which is exactly what drove me to data science work &#8212; I think that both tech and humanities communities  make this sort of collaborative approach more difficult than it needs to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just thinking about how you learn computation, (&#8230;) but it\u2019s also students having an awareness of the larger political, social context in which we\u2019re all living.\u201d\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The article also reminded me of one of my friends in academia, who started off as a mathematician but then moved on to philosophy of mathematics. While academics usually do not enjoy teaching introductory classes to undergrads &#8212; and he thought he wouldn&#8217;t either &#8212; he ended up actually being really into it. He said the main thing that changed his mind was that teaching compulsory Introduction to Philosophy or Ethics in AI classes to Computer Science undergrads at an elite US university known for its CS department was the one area of his job where he believed that he was making a very valuable impact. He is now thinking of maybe holding similar types of classes to engineers working in the industry in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see a lot more of these types of efforts, calls for action and rallies for co-operation between humanities and tech lately, I feel like it is all finally coming together after we have briefly seen the impact of what happens when we ignore one over the other &#8212; and I really welcome these initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charles Earl</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/charles.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/charles.png?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-865\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> A few months ago, Ben Hutchinson, Margaret Mitchell, and Shira Mitchell gave the thought provoking talk, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nksfAaEJtm8&amp;list=PLXA0IWa3BpHk7fE8IH6wXNEfAZyr3A5Yb&amp;index=17&amp;t=0s\" rel=\"nofollow\">A History of Quantitative Fairness in Testing</a>,&#8221; at the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency Conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a look back at the efforts &#8212; beginning in the 1950s &#8212; to create fair and unbiased standardized tests. The presenters argued that current efforts to build unbiased AI systems are in profound ways similar to the approaches taken by educational researchers of the past. Like the machine learning and AI developers of today, the educational researchers had lofty goals: they wanted to develop quantitative methodologies that could correct for the deeply ingrained gender, racial, and class disparities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The persistent inequities evidenced by the on-going <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/us/college-admissions-race.html?rref=collection%2Fnewseventcollection%2Fcollege-admissions-scandal&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=us\u00aeion=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\" rel=\"nofollow\">U.S. College Admissions scandal</a> is a stark reminder of the failings of the quantitative fairness effort in standardized testing. I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ve been able to learn enough not to repeat the egregious mistakes of the past, clearly we need to.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>I attended the <a href=\"https://fatconference.org/2019/program.html\">Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency Conference</a> in Atlanta from January 29th &#8212; 31st.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This conference brings together a diverse community &#8212; academics, lawyers, policy makers, software developers &#8212; concerned with the fairness of the socio-technical systems that control our lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most visceral examples of &#8220;socio-technical&#8221; are the policing and sentencing support systems in use throughout the world. Automattic&#8217;s Grand Meetup last year took place in   Orlando, Florida &#8212; a city that is debating whether to widely deploy a <a href=\"https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/10/18/city-of-orlando-launches-second-test-of-amazons-facial-recognition-software\">problematic facial recognition system</a> <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/201902/buolamwini-responds-to-amazon-as-police-admit-facial-recognition-recommendations-not-followed\">developed by Amazon</a>. There are ethical and human rights issues raised by the development and deployment of this and similar systems. The conference is one attempt to get a constructive, outcome-oriented dialog going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research presented at the conference revolves around a number of questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Is a given machine learning system negatively impacting a given group?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can we develop methodologies for auditing software systems for harm?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can we develop metrics that quantify fairness?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can we develop methodologies that make the internals of machine learning and A.I. more accessible to policy makers and the citizenry impacted by them?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this year&#8217;s conference did not have the incisiveness of last year&#8217;s, where there were memorable and prescient talks by Latanya Sweeney and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/joy-buolamwini/#7cf2339e358a\">Joy Buolamwini</a>. Nonetheless there were gems this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the award papers truly had a positive outcome &#8212; illustrating how incorporating fairness/impact/justice assessment into system design can lead to quality of life improvements. Sendil Mullainathan presented <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3287593\">Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm that Guides Health Decisions for 70 million people</a>. It began as an empirical study, examining how the intervention patterns of<br>\na targeted healthcare software used by several insurance companies leaves out significant swaths of African American patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullainathan thought to contact the software provider shortly after publishing (expecting to be brushed off), but they were able to collaboratively adjust thresholds for intervention, removing 84% of the bias and  hopefully improving the lives of patients with chronic conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a couple of talks that I thought particularly relevant. Christo Wilson (Northeastern) and John Martin (now in marketing at Hubspot) gave a talk on <a href=\"https://cbw.sh/static/pdf/jiang-2019-fat.pdf\">transparency in A/B testing</a>, studying the structure of A/B tests in the wild by analyzing publicly accessible Optimizely data. The organization that deployed the largest number of tests in the study was the <em>New York Times</em>. I think of the paper as a public service announcement for more transparency in A/B testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second was <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf\">model cards</a>, presented by Andrew Zaldivar at Google. This was representative of a set of talks aimed at making models and data more understandable to the people who use and are impacted by them. Zaldivar and his collaborators apparently did a trial run using by deploying it as a decision support tool for a comment forum moderators. In their case, the model cards were intended to provide guidance to forum moderators on the use of a &#8220;comment toxicity&#8221; predictor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of talks challenged the underpinnings of the whole algorithmic fairness/justice enterprise (<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3284598\">#</a>). Particularly sobering was a talk on lessons from failed attempts over the last 50 years to address racial/gender/class inequities from standardized testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were many other thought provoking talks and discussions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Several toolkits for assessing the fairness of predictors and building interpretable models (<a href=\"//github.com/algofairness/fairness-comparison\">#</a>, <a href=\"https://fatconference.org/static/tutorials/hall_interpretable18.pdf\">#</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/conversationai/unintended-ml-bias-analysis/blob/master/presentations/FAT_star_tutorial.md\">#</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Providing more transparency to those people negatively impacted by automation (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06514.pdf\">#</a> ).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Discussion of an open source tool that was developed in the U.K. with strong involvement from the community, attention to human rights concerns, and continuous vetting (<a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/helping-police-make-custody-decisions-using-artificial-intelligence\">#</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The conference will be held next year in Barcelona.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the central issue is not a technological but societal problem. The long term impact of the work is in the degree to which it enables citizens to make more informed decisions about the role that increasingly autonomous technology should play in their societies.</p>\n",

I was ecstatic and felt like a \u201cchild in the candy shop.\u201d Then came Andre Ng\u2019s famous machine learning course which started the era of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). For several years, I was sure that MOOCs would change the face of higher education worldwide. But it seems that I was too optimistic. Data collected over the years shows ever decreasing MOOC participation and engagement. I wonder whether there are other emerging concepts that will manage to revolutionize education.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Xiao Yu</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/xiaoyu.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/xiaoyu.jpeg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1396\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/02/ais-quickly-learn-to-collude.html\">AIs Quickly Learn to Collude</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a bit tangential to what we normally post but it\u2019s pretty interesting how algorithmic pricing &#8212; even when not designed to &#8212; <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/artificial-intelligence-algorithmic-pricing-and-collusion\">ends up colluding with each other</a>.

The latest model generates several paragraphs of coherent text that read like a <em>Newsweek</em> article. The most impressive part is that they accomplished this without training on task specific data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model, GPT-2, features 1.5 billion parameters and was trained on 8 million webpages. The post features several examples of generated text, the first being a nine paragraph article about researchers discovering a herd of unicorns in the Andes mountains. The output, based on a human-generated prompt, is astounding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, here\u2019s the question: Did I write this blurb, or was it generated by GPT-2????

    "content": "\n<p>Recently, Automattic created a Marketing Data team to support marketing efforts with dedicated data capabilities. As we got started, one important question loomed for me and my teammate Demet Dagdelen: <i>What should we data scientists do as part of this team?</i></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the term <i>data science</i> has been heavily used in the past few years, its meaning still lacks clarity. <a href=\"https://yanirseroussi.com/2018/07/22/defining-data-science-in-2018/\">My current definition for data science</a> is: \u201c<i>a field that deals with description, prediction, and causal inference from data in a manner that is both domain-independent and domain-aware, with the ultimate goal of supporting decisions.</i>\u201d This is a very broad definition that offers a vague direction for what <i>marketing </i>data scientists should do. Indeed, many ideas for data science work were thrown around when the team was formed. Because Demet and I wanted our work to be proactive and influential, we suggested a long-term marketing data science project: <b>RR++ (Increase Retention Rates)</b>. This post is a high-level overview of the story of RR++ and the lessons we learned while working on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2374\" height=\"720\" data-attachment-id=\"2756\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2019/01/15/how-to-increase-retention-and-revenue-in-1000-nontrivial-steps/rrpp-master-thread/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?fit=2374%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2374,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?fit=300%2C91&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?fit=1024%2C311&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?resize=2374%2C720&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2756\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?w=2374&amp;ssl=1 2374w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?resize=300%2C91&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?resize=1024%2C311&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?resize=768%2C233&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?resize=1536%2C466&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-master-thread.png?resize=2048%2C621&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The beginning of the project master thread on the Marketing Data <a href=\"https://p2theme.com/\">P2</a> message board<br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Defining the project</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem of increasing retention rates is very broad, but it is obvious that for an established subscription-based business like WordPress.com, any increase in retention rates translates to increased long-term revenue. The general idea was to keep the high-level focus on retention rates in mind and see where it\u2019d take us:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:10%;font-style:italic;\">\nOur goal is to take a data-driven approach to a complex metric that touches many different areas of WordPress.com; devise strategies based on available data; and provide outputs teams can use to guide their strategies and tactics intended to reduce churn [i.e., non-retention]. While we will not be implementing the tactics themselves like email marketing or advertising, we will be leading the charge on ensuring the outputs we generate are implemented in useful ways and that the results of these tactics are measured.\n<p></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>We began by breaking up the work into specific milestones and tasks. It was clear that there were too many unknowns to be able to plan everything in advance. Instead, we decided to be flexible, define a general milestone structure, and only plan a few weeks at a time in more detail. Unknowingly, we more-or-less followed <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/11/curiosity-driven-data-science\">Eric Colson\u2019s recent advice on curiosity-driven data science</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:10%;font-style:italic;\">Data science can enable wholly new and innovative capabilities that can completely differentiate a company. But those innovative capabilities aren\u2019t so much designed or envisioned as they are discovered and revealed through curiosity-driven tinkering by the data scientists. So, before you jump on the data science bandwagon, think less about how data science will support and execute your plans and think more about how to create an environment to empower your data scientists to come up with things you never dreamed of.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4008\" height=\"1248\" data-attachment-id=\"2759\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2019/01/15/how-to-increase-retention-and-revenue-in-1000-nontrivial-steps/rrpp-project-flow/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?fit=4008%2C1248&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4008,1248\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rrpp-project-flow\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?fit=300%2C93&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?fit=1024%2C319&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?resize=4008%2C1248&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2759\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?w=4008&amp;ssl=1 4008w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?resize=300%2C93&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?resize=1024%2C319&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?resize=768%2C239&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?resize=1536%2C478&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?resize=2048%2C638&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rrpp-project-flow.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">High-level overview of the main project stages<br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Main project tasks and outcomes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Demet and I spent most of 2018 on the RR++ project, and we could probably write an entire book on the experience. To summarize, here is a high-level overview of the main tasks and outcomes of the project in rough chronological order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Consistent definition of retention for the project.</b> <a href=\"https://yanirseroussi.com/2015/11/23/the-hardest-parts-of-data-science/\">Problem definition</a> and <a href=\"http://daynebatten.com/2016/06/counting-hard-data-science/\">counting</a> are two of the hardest parts of data science. Therefore, one of our first RR++ tasks was agreeing on a definition of retention for the project and capturing it in a derived table that all subsequent analyses would rely on. This included answering questions on the level of measurement (e.g., subscription, site, or user?), what constitutes retention (e.g., is a downgrade to a different paid plan considered churn?), and timeframes for plan renewal (e.g., should a temporary failure to renew due to an expired credit card be seen as churn?).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Research on past and current retention work.</b> Any good research project starts with a review of existing efforts in the field, and RR++ was no exception. As <a href=\"https://whenihavetime.com/2017/05/18/a-million-words-published-at-work-in-a-remote-company/\">most of the communication within Automattic is written and archived for future reference</a>, there was plenty of material to get through. After summarizing our findings, we asked our colleagues for their questions on retention, with the goal of guiding our initial data dive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Simple retention analysis.</b> Once we had our retention definition and table in place, it was time to run some basic analyses to ensure that our data matched existing resources. We visualized the data with cohort-based <a href=\"https://amplitude.com/blog/2016/01/27/understanding-user-retention\">retention curves</a>, and used <a href=\"https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">the Python lifelines package</a> to perform basic survival analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Consistent and repeatable feature generation process.</b> Answering the most interesting retention questions requires going beyond the basic retention data to uncover factors associated with churn. Such factors are commonly referred to as <i>features</i>. In our case, features are characteristics of sites and users. When we started working on RR++, pipe (<a href=\"https://data.blog/2018/11/15/introducing-pipe-the-automattic-machine-learning-pipeline/\">the Automattic machine learning pipeline</a>) had some rudimentary feature generation capabilities, but there was no way of using the features outside of pipe. To facilitate reproducible analyses with pipe-generated features, we extended pipe to include a command to generate features for any list of sites or users. We also spent several weeks defining all the features we could think of that may be related to retention, and wrote queries to extract them from various database tables. This part of RR++ turned out to be useful for many projects, so we now have data engineer Rob Landers working on scaling the feature generation process and storage, and making features available through a standalone system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Feature-based survival analysis and pipe retention models.</b> With a reliable feature generation process and a large number of features to explore, it was time to dive deeper into the data. I focused on feature-based survival analysis and regression, while Demet worked on extending pipe\u2019s capabilities to support building retention models. Both directions yielded similar results in uncovering factors that lead to churn. Notably, one repeated finding was that <i>not</i> mapping a custom domain to a site (e.g., using datadotblog.wordpress.com instead of data.blog) was very likely to lead to churn. Unfortunately, the large effect of this factor turned out to be due to a bug in the query we used for generating the domain mapping features. However, this part of the project yielded many other non-buggy insights, like high site traffic and user activity being early indicators of retention. In addition, the pipe retention models were reasonably accurate despite minimal tuning, which meant they could potentially be used for retention-increasing interventions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Productionizing predictive model deployment with pipe.</b> To enable interventions based on pipe retention models, we had to ensure that pipe could provide scores continuously without relying on manual work or on any individual\u2019s environment. As with the feature generation phase, we ended up implementing a process that can be used to deploy any predictive model. For details check out <a href=\"https://data.blog/tag/pipe/\">our posts on pipe</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Initial interventions to increase retention.</b> Once we had retention models running in production, it was time to use their scores for the main RR++ goal: increasing retention rates. The first intervention was fairly simple &#8212; we exposed the relative churn risk of sites in our internal support tools. The idea was that knowing that a user owns a site that is at risk of churning would help support staff drive conversations around increasing retention. However, there\u2019s still work to be done in that area, like showing the reasons for churn and being more proactive about contacting at-risk users. Such proactiveness was demonstrated by our second intervention, where we worked with marketers to run an email campaign to encourage early upgrades from a one-year plan to a two-year plan. Our findings from this campaign show that targeting users based on their retention scores yields superior results to unsegmented targeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/i-will-never-stop-learning.png?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1954\" height=\"630\" data-attachment-id=\"2762\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2019/01/15/how-to-increase-retention-and-revenue-in-1000-nontrivial-steps/i-will-never-stop-learning/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/i-will-never-stop-learning.png?fit=1954%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1954,630\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"i-will-never-stop-learning\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/i-will-never-stop-learning.png?fit=300%2C97&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/i-will-never-stop-learning.png?fit=1024%2C330&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/i-will-never-stop-learning.png?resize=1954%2C630&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2762\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/i-will-never-stop-learning.png?w=1954&amp;ssl=1 1954w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/i-will-never-stop-learning.png?resize=300%2C97&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/i-will-never-stop-learning.png?resize=1024%2C330&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/i-will-never-stop-learning.png?resize=768%2C248&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/i-will-never-stop-learning.png?resize=1536%2C495&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">We learned a lot from RR++, in line with the first sentence of <a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/\">the Automattic creed</a>: &#8220;I will never stop learning&#8221;<br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lessons learned</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Working on RR++ has been a fulfilling experience due to the outcomes we delivered and the lessons we learned along the way. We hope that our reflections will be useful for others contemplating similar projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Curiosity-driven data science works.</b> We didn\u2019t know what the outcomes of the project would be when we proposed to focus on the high-level business goal of increasing retention rates. But we knew that keeping this goal in mind would set us on a path that\u2019s aligned with the interests of Automattic and the marketing division. To add one more example to the outcomes described above, my curiosity about survival analysis &#8212; which I haven\u2019t explored before RR++ &#8212; has unexpectedly led me to help our HR department predict attrition rates of Automattic employees, using the same basic technique we used for RR++. In addition, the tools we created are being used across Automattic. For example, we are working with the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a> division to use pipe for their retention models, thereby saving them a lot of work in comparison to building and deploying models from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Verification of ever-changing data and pipelines is challenging, but crucial.</b> As noted above, we reported incorrect results due to a bug in the extraction of domain mapping features. This happened despite performing thorough code reviews and implementing automated tests. As anyone who\u2019s worked with software knows, unless you\u2019re writing trivial code, bugs can creep in even with rigorous verification. Our code is far from trivial, and it relies on live data that can change without warning. This doesn\u2019t mean we should give up on manual and automated verification &#8212; it just means that we can never test everything. Verification allows us to increase our belief that the results we report are valid, but it doesn\u2019t completely eliminate the possibility that some bugs exist. Just like with traditional scientific research, our outputs represent our best knowledge <i>at the time of publication</i>. If new information becomes available &#8212; such as discovering that our assumptions on domain mapping were wrong &#8212; our reported results change accordingly. This is summarized by <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/22/keynes-change-mind/\">a quote commonly attributed to John Maynard Keynes</a>: <i>\u201cWhen the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?\u201d</i> Rigorous verification is required for reducing the likelihood of unexpected changes, but it can\u2019t cover unknown unknowns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Be clear about uncertainty.</b> The uncertainty in RR++ was high, as we didn\u2019t have well-defined deliverables ahead of time. We did our best to communicate this uncertainty, and we were lucky to have the support of our team and division leads in pursuing the somewhat-vague goal of increasing retention rates. In addition to the uncertainty that came from the project definition, there were other unknowns around data reliability (as discussed above) and random variability of statistical estimates. Again, we committed to being open about these sources of uncertainty and aimed to quantify it, rather than pretending that it doesn\u2019t exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Work closely with stakeholders ahead of time.</b> While we were mostly independent in our work, we had some dependencies on other teams. For example, running the pipe-driven email campaign required help from our Customer Marketing colleagues. We met throughout the year, but when the time came to implement the campaign, our proposed approach to using pipe wasn\u2019t fully clear to them. We could have done a better job of keeping them up to date, though Demet and I also went through many iterations until we agreed on the experimental design for the campaign. The approach we came up with wasn\u2019t as simple to explain as a classic A/B test &#8212; Demet will post about it in the near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Working in a pair with the same person for a long time is both challenging and rewarding.</b> Before RR++, neither Demet nor I have worked so closely with another person for such a long period of time. As I\u2019m based in Australia and Demet is based in Hungary, our work hours rarely overlap. However, this hasn\u2019t stopped us from reviewing hundreds of pull requests by each other and having very deep discussions across multiple channels, mostly asynchronously. As one would expect, this wasn\u2019t always a smooth ride &#8212; we had many disagreements and even arguments along the way. But we learned a lot in the process and delivered outcomes that wouldn\u2019t have been possible had we worked independently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>A project acronym should be a pronounceable word.</b> RR++ is a bit of a mouthful &#8212; just try saying \u201car ar plus plus\u201d out loud. Also, the plus symbol can\u2019t be used everywhere, so we changed it to <i>rrpp</i> in file and table names. Choosing that name wasn\u2019t our best decision. For our next project, we\u2019ll choose a better name, like pipe &#8212; simple, monosyllabic, and meaningful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Beyond RR++</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we first conceived the project, retention was an underserved area at Automattic. Now, there\u2019s an entire team dedicated to retention marketing, as well as other retention projects. As we spent plenty of time on building general capabilities into pipe, it became clear that it can be used to serve other marketing and company goals than retention modeling. Going forward, we\u2019ll focus our attention on pipe and its marketing applications. This still includes driving retention campaigns, but we are also aiming to support acquisition and upselling efforts, among other things. We will share more insights from our work in the future.

When it comes to getting data, <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;has two main flows. It can either accept a list of site or user ids for which to generate data, or it can accept a <em>cohort</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cohorts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, for WordPress.com sites, we have three main cohorts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>site_free</code>: Free WP.com sites. For example, a Day 30\u00a0<code>site_free</code>\u00a0cohort would look at a blog\u2019s signup date and would include all blogs that were free in their first 30 days.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>site_paid</code>: Paid WP.com sites. A Day 30\u00a0<code>site_paid</code>\u00a0cohort would be all blogs that have been on a paid plan for 30 days.\u00a0 (Note: they may have registered a year ago, though this cohort only deals with their first purchase date.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>site_any</code>: Similar to the\u00a0<code>site_free</code>\u00a0cohort, this group includes all sites who signed up on a given day. But because there isn&#8217;t a requirement not to have purchased a plan, this cohort can include both free and paid cohorts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we wanted to predict which Day 30 free sites would upgrade to a paid plan by Day 37. Our cohort would be <code>site_free</code>.&nbsp;We would specify a CLI argument to say that we would like to look at Day 30 sites, another argument that specifies that we&#8217;re interested in predicting a plan purchase event, and another argument to set a seven-day conversion window. We would also specify a training date range, let&#8217;s say between <code>2018-01-01</code>&nbsp;and <code>2018-05-01</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we fire up <code>\u200bpipe</code>&nbsp;with these specifications, in the background <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;would:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Get all sites that signed up between 2018-01-01 and 2018-05-01,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep only those that remained free sites for their first 30 days,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get features for these sites for their first 30 days, (as 30 is the cohort analysis days for our cohort), and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get classification labels denoting wether these sites ended up upgrading in the given seven-day conversion window between Day 31 and Day 37.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We would want data only for sites that do not leak any future information and make sure that each site in the training data set has had the same number of days for their conversion window. So if we are looking at Day 37 behaviour of Day 30 sites, we would need to make sure that all sites in our training data set are at least 37 days old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is a lot of product-specific date arithmetic going on in the background to be able to set training date ranges that make sense considering the user-specified cohort and conversion window, which is why it is best to have central and general pipelines to handle these tedious tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could also build models for sites without specifying cohort analysis days. We could say &#8220;build a model for eligible sites&#8217; likelihood to purchase a plan in the next seven days,&#8221; in which case we would get the given sites&#8217; activity until an analysis end date of let&#8217;s say 2018-10-01 and generate labels based on whether or not they purchased a plan by 2018-10-08. We call these untimed cohort projects because they do not specify a time for a cohort, like Day 30 or Day 15 cohorts &#8212; it just says &#8220;any eligible site,&#8221; which in our case would be any site that was on a free plan on 2018-10-01.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding new cohorts to <code>pipe</code> is an easy dev or analyst task. While the example shows WordPress.com cohorts, any product in the Automattic family could have its own cohort. We can also specify our list of sites to be used as training data as a custom list of IDs and bypass the cohort querying.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conversion queries</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying a plan is not the only conversion event for which <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;can build models. Just like cohorts, we can add conversion events in &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; fashion. We have some conversion queries already added to <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;such as a site going from a free plan to a paid plan, or the opposite. Conversion queries come with a base cohort to which they are applied. The cohort specifies site eligibility, and conversion specifies the labels we get for our training data set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a conversion query about going from a free plan to a paid plan makes sense only on a free cohort. We would specify that as: <code>site_free:free_to_paid</code>, where the part before the colon specifies the cohort and the second bit specifies which conversion event we are interested in for that cohort. Or we could build a churn model by specifying <code>site_paid:paid_to_free</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a dynamic conversion query called <code>event_like</code>. Events done by our users and blogs are logged to an <code>events</code>&nbsp;table. (So far there are 5-6,000 distinct logged events.) By joining onto this table, we are able to dynamically generate a conversion query for any event that we log.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, we can generate labels for free or paid sites to see their likelihood to publish a post:&nbsp;<code>site_any:event_like_post_publish</code>&nbsp;or for paid sites to see their likelihood to install or use the simple payments button: <code>site_paid:event_like_simplepayments</code>. This dynamic conversion query does a regex search across all our logged events for the term <code>simplepayments</code>. We can build thousands of machine learning models by only changing one CLI argument so that the term being searched for across our events changes while the search structure remains the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Importance of generalization and independent steps</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is made possible because we treat the list of eligible sites separately from the label that these sites get based on whether they convert or not. So once we have a cohort definition, we get the list of eligible sites. Once we have a list of eligible sites and an analysis date period, we generate labels. Generating labels for a classification task in machine learning (ML) is as easy as just querying an <code>events</code>&nbsp;table to see if the given site performed the given event in a given time period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By making each step of the ML process more-or-less independent from the ones preceding it, we can use the same logic across many different use cases without any need to write more code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides not having to write code, this makes our models reproducible, ensuring that all models are built based on the same set of general rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Turning data into features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Automattic, to generate features, we look at things like logged events done by users or sites, traffic that a site receives, whether they have enabled certain features like Publicize, etc. We have about 20 queries that dynamically generate about 10-30,000 features. (The kind of data you would get for an ML pipeline would change from company to company.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, for us, sites with paid plans are able to perform events that sites with free plans are not. This means that we need to flag our feature queries based on whether they are getting data for a paid or a free or a mixed cohort and automatically provide lists of eligible features we can look at per project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are some general governing ideas about the difference between data and features. Data is messy and usually the more data you have the better it is, though this is not the case for features. <strong>When it comes to features, sometimes less is more</strong> &#8212; which is why feature reduction algorithms exist.&nbsp;Features should be <strong>compact, informative, and representative</strong>; they are usually informed by domain expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Features are derived from data. For example, if you look at when a site registered, the site registration date would be your data. But the specific date that a site registered would also be absolutely useless information when building a model. So you turn that one piece of data into features by looking into context: Which day of the week did the site register? Which week of the month? Which quarter of the year?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.09.51.png?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1932\" height=\"830\" data-attachment-id=\"2714\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2019/01/08/building-thousands-of-reproducible-ml-models-with-pipe-the-automattic-machine-learning-pipeline/screen-shot-2018-12-22-at-18-09-51/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.09.51.png?fit=1932%2C830&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1932,830\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2018-12-22 at 18.09.51\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.09.51.png?fit=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.09.51.png?fit=1024%2C440&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.09.51.png?resize=1932%2C830&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2714\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.09.51.png?w=1932&amp;ssl=1 1932w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.09.51.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.09.51.png?resize=1024%2C440&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.09.51.png?resize=768%2C330&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.09.51.png?resize=1536%2C660&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, your model can learn insights such as &#8220;sites registering on Mondays are more likely to churn,&#8221;

We do cross validation, some light parameter tuning, and we are currently introducing better feature pre-processing via Pipelines. We are currently only building simple Random Forests as they perform well enough for our needs, but will also be looking into other models that can provide feature importances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feature importances show which features contributed information gain to the model. We have discovered things such as Portuguese speaking users being more likely to churn, or signup for the day of week being a contributor to a site&#8217;s likelihood to churn from looking at feature importances. However, usually they do not provide huge insight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They do serve a better purpose though and we can use a threshold for feature importance to train better models by getting rid of features that do not contribute much to a model&#8217;s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.34.12.png?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1922\" height=\"856\" data-attachment-id=\"2717\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2019/01/08/building-thousands-of-reproducible-ml-models-with-pipe-the-automattic-machine-learning-pipeline/screen-shot-2018-12-22-at-18-34-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.34.12.png?fit=1922%2C856&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1922,856\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2018-12-22 at 18.34.12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.34.12.png?fit=300%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.34.12.png?fit=1024%2C456&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.34.12.png?resize=1922%2C856&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2717\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.34.12.png?w=1922&amp;ssl=1 1922w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.34.12.png?resize=300%2C134&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.34.12.png?resize=1024%2C456&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.34.12.png?resize=768%2C342&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-22-at-18.34.12.png?resize=1536%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://data.blog/author/yanirseroussi/\">Yanir</a> and I did early prototyping, we kept coming back to the same idea: the importance of well-defined features.

It is technical and challenging to figure out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://blog.dominodatalab.com/data-science-vs-engineering-tension-points/\">Source</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest, building a machine learning pipeline did not arise from a specific need. I used to call <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;&#8220;<a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/wont-just-work/\">The ML pipeline no one asked for</a>.&#8221; However, especially as we kept on working on it, it became obvious, at least to me, that if you would like to use ML models in your business&nbsp;then investing resources in a generalized pipeline upfront will save you from months of work <em>per project</em>.&nbsp;Of course, there will be ML projects that can&#8217;t fit into <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;or a similar pipeline as they will require bespoke, more specific modelling work. We have teams at Automattic working on such models, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But &#8212; for the more general questions that most companies deal with &#8212; an end-to-end pipeline is, I believe, the better option because:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Every step of building a data product is rife with opportunities for introducing bugs or making the wrong assumptions. This is the nature of our work. You generally don&#8217;t realize these until after you have put in weeks of work, and sometimes not even then. You may realize one wrong assumption and fix it but the data scientist after you may easily make the same mistakes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A lot of the work is about getting things off your local computer to actual production. Ideally, there is one clear path to production, if one ML model is able to do it, the same path should be provided for all other projects, too. This will save a tremendous amount of effort and time in the long run, as well as ensure that the path to production is well-maintained as all ML projects at the company use it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>An ML model without impactful application is useless, and it is hard to estimate impact without building at least a preliminary solution. Being able to build models with the click of a button means it is not a big investment to try out ideas and test impact.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While data scientists are generally hired to be part statistician, dev, mathematician, frequentist, bayesian, data engineer, and ML practitioner, we are more skilled in some areas than others, so a common effort to provide a general solution will likely produce better results than many one-off efforts even if it takes more time initially.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The problems you have to solve with these types of ML and data products are easily generalizable, so it makes sense to generalize the solution, too.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Less data scientist time spent on dealing with data engineering and pure development means more time to spend on why companies generally hire data scientists: turning the model results into good business decisions.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>There seem to be quite a few businesses that provide ready-made ML pipelines for companies, however, as you can see from the way something like <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;is built, an ML pipeline is usually very tied to business logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some solutions can help automate the model training and tuning part of the process, it is also the part of <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;that we spend the least amount of time on. Model training&nbsp;in <code>pipe</code> is quite underdeveloped and boring, but while we are working on making it better and a bit more exciting, we found that it is actually good enough as it is. Most of our time is spent on getting our business logic into the system through defining cohorts, features, and conversion events and engineering it all together to form a clear path to deployment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Up next</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next installment in the <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;series for data.blog, we&#8217;ll look at using predictive models in Marketing, experiment setups for online evaluation, uplift modeling, and building models that are useful as opposed to just accurate.</p>\n",

Recently, Richard talked about his thesis with data visualization enthusiasts at Automattic. Before Richard&#8217;s talk, it seemed me that text has been treated as a &#8220;second-class citizen&#8221; in the data visualization world. But even I was surprised about the wealth of visual information that we can offer using text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard Brath was kind enough to allow us to publish his talk for the global audience.

    "content": "\n<p>A generalized machine learning pipeline, <code>pipe</code> serves the entire company and helps Automatticians seamlessly build and deploy machine learning models to predict the likelihood that a given event may occur, e.g., installing a plugin, purchasing a plan, or churning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A team effort, <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;provides general, long-term, and robust solutions to common or important problems our product and marketing teams face. When I first joined Automattic almost exactly three years ago, my tasks were two-fold:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I had the autonomy and freedom to delve deep into topics of my choice, which at the time revolved around uncovering the networks hiding <a href=\"https://data.blog/2016/12/20/a-brand-image-analysis-of-wordpress-on-twitter/\">within</a> <a href=\"https://data.blog/2016/10/11/network-science-at-automattic-mapping-the-communities-of-wp-com-methodology/\">our</a> <a href=\"https://data.blog/2016/09/13/network-science-at-automattic-mapping-the-communities-of-wp-com/\">communities</a> <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/08/08/how-communication-density-fuels-automattic/\">using</a> <a href=\"https://data.blog/2018/02/01/analysis-of-a-beautiful-storm-internal-communication-at-automattic/\">network</a> <a href=\"https://data.blog/2018/10/17/the-most-beautiful-social-network-the-structure-of-communication-at-automattic/\">science</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>But like most data scientists in the industry, most of my time was spent serving product and marketing teams by providing answers to their data questions which ranged from running simple SQL-like queries to doing more in-depth &#8212; but one-off &#8212; statistical analyses.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We soon realized that while serving product and marketing teams must remain one of our main goals, we would be better off providing and maintaining general solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We experimented with embedding a data scientist on a team for three months, so that we would work more closely with teams that can benefit from data products and provide longer-term solutions instead of one-off analyses or models. And this is how <code>pipe</code> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data science meets Marketing: first steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My data science-marketing stint started with a a list of questions from Customer Marketing. The Customer Marketing team is responsible for our email campaigns, and they wanted to make their email campaigns more efficient. They wanted to find out which of their users could do without the Day 30 email that everyone received, so I started to tackle the following question:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Which free Day 30 users will upgrade to a paid plan by Day 44?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since all Day 30 users receive this email, we could build a free-to-paid model that tells us which users act on it in order to only target similar users instead of everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took about three months to build the first pipeline that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Gets eligible users on a daily basis.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Scores their likelihood to buy a plan based on pre-built models.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Stores these likelihoods in a Hadoop table.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Puts the users in buckets for A/B tests.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Evaluates model performance on a daily basis.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Identifies</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&nbsp;important features that contribute to the likelihood score.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Generalizes this question to achieve the same flow for any Day N cohort. (Which Day 15/20/90&#8230;etc. users will buy a plan in the next 7/10/20&#8230;etc. days?)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5

/></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the development time was spent on building the pipeline for generating, cleaning, and transforming the data and running the flow on a daily basis. The traditional &#8220;data science&#8221; work took only about one week of the three-month rotation as the data and software engineering issues had to be tackled first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We ran a <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/09/05/easier-ab-tests-with-automattics-own-tool-hypotheses/\">bayesian A/B test</a> for an email campaign for Day 38 users to see if the model was actually selecting the users most likely to upgrade and found that it performed <em>well enough</em>. <strong>Those that the model selected as likely to buy a plan purchased plans at ~350% higher rate&nbsp;</strong>as a response to the email than a random selection of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Problems with the free-to-paid project</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 350% higher conversion rate as a result of an A/B test sounds like a marketer&#8217;s dream, so the project at a first glance was successful. However, there were many issues:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We <strong>only proved that the model performs well and is able to select users who will upgrade</strong>, but it does not select users that upgrade due to our marketing efforts. These users may have upgraded with or without our email since we scored them only on their likelihood to buy a plan.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While the conversion&nbsp;<em>rate</em> in the test group was high, the raw conversion numbers did not point to as high an impact. So the number reported for the increase in rate was not so important.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We had technical issues with the robustness of the flow that needed data engineering help.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We realized that raw likelihood scores may be more useful if they were about churn rather than likelihood to buy a plan.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So the question now became:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Can we generalize this flow and make it more robust so that we can quickly pivot in situations like these?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the answer was &#8220;yes, we can, but we need more time and resources,&#8221;&nbsp;the effort became its own project under a new team. My colleague&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.blog/author/yanirseroussi/\">Yanir Seroussi</a> joined me. We named the project <code>pipe</code> &#8212; inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzai_Pipeline\">a wave</a> that neither of us will ever get to surf \ud83d\ude42</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What pipe does</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><code>pipe</code>&nbsp;builds machine learning models based on a site&#8217;s likelihood to perform <em>any</em> event that we track. These events can include a site publishing a post or a page, installing a plugin, or activating a theme. Once the event we want to build models for is specified in the command line interface, along with a unique project name, the cohort of the sites we are interested in (e.g., a free Day 30 cohort would be free sites that registered 30 days ago), and a conversion window, <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;will automatically:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Generate training data labels for eligible sites.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Generate features for these sites.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Build a predictive model on the fly and save some information about model performance metrics and feature importances.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Deploy the model and flow to our Hadoop clusters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Start generating daily likelihood scores using the model for new eligible sites and save them in a Hadoop table.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Generate daily offline evaluations of model performance for sites that have reached the end of their conversion window and save these in a Hadoop table.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Put sites into A/B test groups on a daily basis based on their likelihood scores. These A/B test group assignments for each site owner are also saved in a separate Hadoop table and can be used to run experiments to evaluate the model.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/copy-of-pipe-flow-1.png?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1440\" height=\"600\" data-attachment-id=\"2679\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/11/15/introducing-pipe-the-automattic-machine-learning-pipeline/copy-of-pipe-flow-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/copy-of-pipe-flow-1.png?fit=1440%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pipe-ml-pipeline\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The Automattic Machine Learning Pipeline&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/copy-of-pipe-flow-1.png?fit=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/copy-of-pipe-flow-1.png?fit=1024%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/copy-of-pipe-flow-1.png?resize=1440%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2679\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/copy-of-pipe-flow-1.png?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/copy-of-pipe-flow-1.png?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/copy-of-pipe-flow-1.png?resize=1024%2C427&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/copy-of-pipe-flow-1.png?resize=768%2C320&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Automattic Machine Learning Pipeline</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example questions pipe can automatically build models for:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Which free Day 15 sites will purchase a plan by Day 30?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Which free Day 30 sites will purchase a plan by Day 37?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Which paid Day 60 sites will churn by Day 90?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Which paid Day 60 sites will fail to renew by end of their first year?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Which free or paid sites that registered seven days ago will use the mobile app in the next 10 days?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Which sites that became paid 30 days ago will install the simple payments button in the next 15 days?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts coming up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a series of posts published on data.blog about <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;in the coming months:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How <code>pipe</code>&nbsp;does what it does: a more in-depth look into <code>pipe</code> outputs and how <code>pipe</code> generates features, builds models, and does offline evaluations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using predictive models in Marketing: experiment setups for online evaluation; uplift modeling; building models that are useful as opposed to just accurate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gotchas in machine learning:&nbsp;what to look out for when building machine learning models, and a discussion of common mistakes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

These are all things we have looked into, stay tuned for subsequent posts on our HR analyses!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Social Network Analysis (SNA) basics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We at Automattic <strong>create and engage with content as part of our jobs</strong>. We mainly use P2s, our network of internal blogs, to communicate with each other. We post about everything from new projects to meetup activities we&#8217;re planning, or A/B test results. Everyone in the company is invited to join the conversation that follows any P2 post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we drew the network of Automatticians previously, <strong>each node in the network represented a person</strong>. And every time a person <strong>liked or commented on another&#8217;s post</strong>, a line was drawn between them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gave us <strong>a social network</strong> that is ripe for analysis! When it comes to social network analysis, we&#8217;re mainly interested in <strong>finding cliques</strong> by figuring out if certain nodes are more connected to each other than they are to others (clustering), and <strong>quantifying the importance of nodes</strong> in the network in different ways (network centralities).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Network centrality metrics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the previous analysis, we looked at how to find cliques via clustering, and found seven distinct cliques within our Automattician-to-Automattician network. We also calculated each person&#8217;s PageRank within the network and found that Matt, our CEO, has the highest PageRank score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PageRank is only one of the many metrics we can use to rank nodes in a network. Other straightforward approaches include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>In-degree centrality:</strong> The number of incoming connections a node has.\u00a0For example, if 100 distinct people liked or commented on a person&#8217;s post, then their in-degree would be 100.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weighted in-degree centrality:</strong> This, in our case, is the number of interactions a person receives. For example, if a person&#8217;s post receives 1,000 likes and comments, then their weighted in-degree is 1,000.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weighted out-degree centrality:</strong> This is the number of times a person interacts with others within the company.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Betweenness centrality</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One of the biggest advantages of a network-driven approach is that it gives a way to look at data in a structure that makes different cliques visible.&nbsp;An interesting thing about cliques is that they have<strong>&nbsp;easy access to information flow between nodes within their own clique</strong>, but two cliques might not know much about the happenings in the other clique,<strong>&nbsp;since information doesn\u2019t flow so easily&nbsp;<em>between</em>&nbsp;cliques</strong>. There are always nodes in networks that&nbsp;<strong>act as bridges between these different groups;</strong>&nbsp;between whom the information flow is otherwise difficult. There is a metric that shows each node&#8217;s&nbsp;<strong>capability to act as a bridge</strong>. This metric is called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noreferrer\">betweenness centrality</a>.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A node might have very few connections, but could hold a very important position within the network in terms of connecting cliques/sub-cliques that might otherwise be separated from each other.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Sometimes it makes sense to target nodes that act as so-called &#8220;network bridges,&#8221; and this is when betweenness centrality comes into play.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A node&#8217;s betweeness centrality is the number of shortest paths the node falls into when the shortest paths between all node pairs in the network is calculated.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-full wp-image-2638\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"209\" data-attachment-id=\"2638\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/10/17/the-most-beautiful-social-network-the-structure-of-communication-at-automattic/fig16_betweeness_centrality-500x209/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fig16_betweeness_centrality-500x209-1.png?fit=500%2C209&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,209\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Fig16_betweeness_centrality-500&#215;209\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Source: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/network-analysis-protein-interaction-data-introduction/building-and-analysing-ppins-3&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fig16_betweeness_centrality-500x209-1.png?fit=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fig16_betweeness_centrality-500x209-1.png?fit=500%2C209&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fig16_betweeness_centrality-500x209-1.png?resize=500%2C209&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Fig16_betweeness_centrality-500x209\" class=\"wp-image-2638\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fig16_betweeness_centrality-500x209-1.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fig16_betweeness_centrality-500x209-1.png?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/network-analysis-protein-interaction-data-introduction/building-and-analysing-ppins-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/network-analysis-protein-interaction-data-introduction/building-and-analysing-ppins-3</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closeness centrality</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While a node may be connecting different clusters together (high betweenness), or might have many connections (high in-degree) or a fewer but important connections (high PageRank), in some cases, the node\u2019s distance \u2013<strong>&nbsp;its ability to quickly be infected and infect others</strong>&nbsp;\u2013 to other nodes might be more important in terms of its influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These nodes should meet the criteria of<strong>&nbsp;being tied to many important nodes</strong>&nbsp;in the network.

Vega is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise JSON syntax for rapidly generating visualizations to support analysis. Altair is a package that generates Vega graphics from Python. Unlike Matplotlib, Vega (and Altair) target web graphics that support interactivity &#8212; by generating JavaScript documents that can be customized easily. Personally, I would not use Altair-based images to create static publication-ready images, however, they are a very good fit for interactive data exploration.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>How to not screw up with machine learning in production</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This <a href=\"https://www.euroscipy.org/2018/descriptions/How%20to%20not%20screw%20up%20with%20machine%20learning%20in%20production%20(and%20more%20about%20engineering%20in%20data%20science).html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">short and good talk</a></span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> by Denys Kovalenko surveys several \u201cdeadly sins\u201d of having machine learning in production. Even if you are new to delivering machine learning solutions to production, or don\u2019t deal with it on a daily basis, &nbsp;I highly recommend that you </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qz6HmfzrABA?t=57m30s\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">watch this talk on YouTube. </span></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Running time optimization and profiling</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There were several talks and workshops devoted to running time optimization and profiling.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The tutorial \u201c</span><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://youtu.be/utLg03Pu754\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">From exploratory computing to performances, a tour of Python profiling and optimization</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201d &nbsp;by Antonio Ingargiola dealt with overall strategies and offered a survey of existing methods. One of the biggest surprises for me was the fact that several mathematical computations can be much faster when performed with the standard <code>math</code> module, compared to the corresponding functions of NumPy.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The tutorial by Matti Picus, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EABNkHRtMLo\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">CFFI, Ctypes, Cython The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, demonstrated several ways to implement mathematical computations in C, with subsequent embedding in Python code using CFFI, Ctypes, and Cython). The speed improvement was very impressive \u2014 up to a factor of six. Even more impressive was that fact that after fiddling with C/Python integration, Matti executed the original pure Python code without any modifications, using PyPy which resulted in execution time that was very similar to the pure C implementation. Before you switch your own programs to PyPy, it\u2019s worth remembering that PyPy is very fast with pure Python functions but is much slower when dealing with functions that are already implemented in C, such as NumPy and the bigger chunks of Pandas.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Another related talk, \u201cBenchmarking and performance analysis for scientific Python\u201d provided a survey of profiling methods and promoted </span><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://github.com/symerio/neurtu\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">https://github.com/symerio/neurtu</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> \u2014 a simple performance measurement tool.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Data privacy for data scientists</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">An interesting workshop by Katharine Jarmul who surveyed several ways to anonymize and de-anonymize data. The workshop\u2019s most important message &nbsp;was that sharing anonymized data is a complex task. Once you do it, someone will try to de-anonymize it, which means that sharing such data needs to be done with a great deal of caution. It is good to remember that several solutions exist. See the </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/P23kTmnG7Lc\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">tutorial video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> to learn about some of them.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>scikit-learn</b><b> and tabular data: closing the gap</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This talk was presented by Gael Varoquaux, &nbsp;one of the core contributors to scikit-learn \u2014 THE machine learning library in the Python ecosystem. Gael reviewed the upcoming changes in sklearn 0.20 (expected to be released very soon). The bigger changes in 0.20 deal with easier data pipelining, especially when dealing with tabular data with mixed data types. They also plan to have &nbsp;better support for categorical data. One of the biggest problems with <code>sklearn</code> is that it doesn\u2019t fully support Pandas data types. Although we can send Pandas DataFrames and Series to sklearn, the output is always a NumPy array or a matrix. Both of them lack the variable names, which makes model analysis harder. This problem won\u2019t be solved in 0.20 but it\u2019s good to know that it is on the developers\u2019 minds. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This brings us to the next talk.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>NumPy: where we are and where we want to be</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Matti Picus (mentioned earlier), is one of the two full-time programmers employed to develop NumPy. According to Matti, the project\u2019s main effort is &nbsp;on compatibility with other libraries such as sklearn (see above) and Dask. These improvements will provide several useful features such as native support of categorical data types in sklearn, and special value for \u201cmissing data\u201d (currently, categories are encoded as integers, and missing values are encoded as special values).</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">According to Matti, the team\u2019s priorities are determined by &nbsp;community demand, as is tracked in the </span><a href=\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">NumPy issue tracker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.

Formally speaking, a data class is a regular class with several \u201cmagic\u201d functions that are auto-generated by a decorator. These function include &nbsp;<strong>init</strong>, <strong>repr</strong>, and others. Data classes exist in the standard Python library since 3.7 but can be installed as a package in 3.6.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Final words</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">EuroSciPy 2018 was an excellent experience for me, and from what I understand, for many more attendees.

After each visit you can update the bounds and after a sufficient number visits you have a winner. The main difference to more traditional AB testing is that the process is more adaptive and less time is wasted on exposing an inferior product to the user.&#8221; Imagine my delight when I saw this morning a free draft copy of an <a href=\"http://downloads.tor-lattimore.com/banditbook/book.pdf\">extensive book</a> (PDF) on the subject, by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also enjoyed two YouTube lectures over the last couple of weeks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what &#8220;Tensor&#8221; really means see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8uT6hgMt00\">Tamara Kolda&#8217;s excellent lecture</a>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ABAU_V8qI\">London PyData talk by Vincent D.

The problem for continuous values is a relatively easy one &#8212; you create a scatter plot with the predicted values on the X-axis and observed values on the Y-axis (not the other way around! See <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380008002305\">this paper</a> to understand why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until recently, I couldn&#8217;t find a useful graph that would compare predictions and observations for a binary label case.

People don&#8217;t just ask Siri to convert from metric to imperial measures &#8212; they sometimes share their deepest feelings. Aronson and Duportail offer a fascinating look at the cultural foundations behind the responses that artificial intelligence like Siri and Alisa offer to expressions of human feeling and emotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What reads have recently rocked your world in the field of Data Science?

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/07/24/investigating-seasonality-in-a-time-series-a-mystery-in-three-parts/",
    "content": "\n<p>Recently, I was asked to determine the extent to which seasonality influenced a particular time series. No problem, right? The <code>statsmodels</code> Python <a href=\"http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose.html\">package</a> has a <code>seasonal_decompose</code> function that seemed pretty handy; and there&#8217;s always Google! As it turns out, this was a bit trickier than I expected. In this post I\u2019ll share some of the problems I encountered while working on this project and how I solved them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In attempting to find posts or papers that &nbsp;addressed quantifying the extent to which the time series was driven by seasonality, every example I came across fell into one of two categories:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Here&#8217;s a few lines of code that produce a visualization of a time series decomposition.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Here&#8217;s how you can remove the seasonality component of a time series, thus stabilizing your time series before building a predictive model.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, each example started with \u201cHere\u2019s a time series with a seasonal trend.\u201d Not super helpful for when you\u2019re trying to determine <em>how much</em> seasonality drives a particular time series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I couldn&#8217;t find was anything that definitively stated how to quantify the extent to which a time series was driven by seasonality. I found some conflicting information about seasonal indexing, and decided to move on. Granted, if I had continued looking, I imagine that eventually I would have found <em>something</em>. But instead, I decided to experiment!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Series Decomposition</b></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start out, I decomposed the time series into its trend, seasonality, and noise components. Here&#8217;s an example of what that looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter wp-image-2601\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"424\" height=\"280\" data-attachment-id=\"2601\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/07/24/investigating-seasonality-in-a-time-series-a-mystery-in-three-parts/jetpack_decomposition/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jetpack_decomposition.png?fit=424%2C280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"424,280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"jetpack_decomposition\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jetpack_decomposition.png?fit=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jetpack_decomposition.png?fit=424%2C280&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jetpack_decomposition.png?resize=424%2C280&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"jetpack_decomposition\" class=\"wp-image-2601\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jetpack_decomposition.png?w=424&amp;ssl=1 424w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jetpack_decomposition.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">How seasonal is this time series? \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, it looks like the data is obviously seasonal, judging by the periodicity in the seasonal decomposition component. But, in Googling several examples of seasonal decomposition, every seasonal component I came across displayed periodicity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I made a time series of random data points between 0 and 1000, and decomposed that. Here&#8217;s what that looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter wp-image-2602\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"424\" height=\"280\" data-attachment-id=\"2602\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/07/24/investigating-seasonality-in-a-time-series-a-mystery-in-three-parts/random_decomposition/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/random_decomposition.png?fit=424%2C280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"424,280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"random_decomposition\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/random_decomposition.png?fit=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/random_decomposition.png?fit=424%2C280&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/random_decomposition.png?resize=424%2C280&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"random_decomposition\" class=\"wp-image-2602\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/random_decomposition.png?w=424&amp;ssl=1 424w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/random_decomposition.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Holy periodicity, Batman!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It also displays periodicity! But, if we look at the y axis in each of these components, note that the noise component has the largest range in the random time series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the time series in question, the seasonal component has a much smaller range than the trend or the noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Trend range = 2000 (3000 to 5000)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seasonal range = 500 (-250 to 250)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Noise range = 2000 (-1000 to 1000)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>(I noticed that the trend and noise ranges have the same magnitude here, but I don&#8217;t know what that means. If you know, I&#8217;d love to hear about it in the comments!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just for fun, here&#8217;s the decomposition for a time series that is completely seasonal. Every January has a value of 100, increasing by 100 each month until reaching 1200 in December, and falling back to 100 again January.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter wp-image-2603\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"424\" height=\"280\" data-attachment-id=\"2603\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/07/24/investigating-seasonality-in-a-time-series-a-mystery-in-three-parts/seasonal_decomposition/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seasonal_decomposition.png?fit=424%2C280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"424,280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"seasonal_decomposition\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seasonal_decomposition.png?fit=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seasonal_decomposition.png?fit=424%2C280&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seasonal_decomposition.png?resize=424%2C280&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"seasonal_decomposition\" class=\"wp-image-2603\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seasonal_decomposition.png?w=424&amp;ssl=1 424w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seasonal_decomposition.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Purely seasonal time series. Makes sense.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The trend and noise components are a constant value of 0, as you would expect in data that is driven purely by a seasonal trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that our series looks much closer to the random data than it does to the purely seasonal data, the results of the seasonal decomposition seem to point to a weak seasonality, if any. At this point in the analysis, I&#8217;m a little skeptical of the conclusions here, so, I decided to look for more evidence. On to another method!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>De-trending</b></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the process of removing the trend dependency that may be present within a time series. I used the <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/remove-trends-seasonality-difference-transform-python/\">differencing method</a> to inspect the trend dependencies of our data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you have a data set with a strong yearly seasonal trend. If you want to predict what the value for June will be, looking at the value from June last year will give you the most information about what you can expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now imagine you have a trend that doesn&#8217;t fluctuate in a periodic way, it simply increases or decreases. If you wanted to predict your sales for June, you would get more information from looking at the month(s) directly preceding June, than from looking at June from last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these trends can be removed from a time series. In differencing, you are basically subtracting the most relevant previous values to account for the trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, removing an \u201cup-and-to-the-right\u201d trend from a time series essentially rotates the graph until it&#8217;s flat, leaving the &#8220;right,&#8221; but stabilizing the &#8220;up.&#8221; Removing a seasonal trend basically smooths out the bumps in the graph. De-trending a time series is often used to produce a stationary series from which you can build a forecasting model. Here&#8217;s an example of removing an up-and-to-the-right trend from a data set.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone wp-image-2604\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2220\" height=\"864\" data-attachment-id=\"2604\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/07/24/investigating-seasonality-in-a-time-series-a-mystery-in-three-parts/side_by_side_detrend/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/side_by_side_detrend.png?fit=2220%2C864&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2220,864\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"side_by_side_detrend\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/side_by_side_detrend.png?fit=300%2C117&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/side_by_side_detrend.png?fit=1024%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/side_by_side_detrend.png?resize=2220%2C864&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"side_by_side_detrend\" class=\"wp-image-2604\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/side_by_side_detrend.png?w=2220&amp;ssl=1 2220w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/side_by_side_detrend.png?resize=300%2C117&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/side_by_side_detrend.png?resize=1024%2C399&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/side_by_side_detrend.png?resize=768%2C299&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/side_by_side_detrend.png?resize=1536%2C598&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/side_by_side_detrend.png?resize=2048%2C797&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Before and after: stabilizing a time series</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I reasoned, by removing a particular type of trend and comparing the resulting series with the original, we could make a judgement about the amount of &#8220;influence&#8221; the particular series has on the original time series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how each differencing process affects the series.

There is <i>some</i> affect from removing a seasonal trend, though. So, this reinforced my earlier conclusion; that if there is seasonality in this data, it&#8217;s weak compared to the overall trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, this didn&#8217;t seem completely thorough, so I checked one more thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Autocorrelation function</b></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over that weekend, while having monthly math beers (Yes! That&#8217;s a thing!), one of my grad school friends recommended that I look at the autocorrelation function, or ACF.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The autocorrelation function shows how well a data set correlates to a time-shifted version of itself.

The spikes outside of the cone are for versions shifted by much smaller intervals than 12, meaning that as you shift the data farther from itself the correlation decreases. This suggests to me that the general trend of the time series has a much stronger influence on the series than a seasonal trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in short, (just kidding, <i>very</i> long!) I didn\u2019t find overwhelming evidence that seasonality plays much of a role in our series. &nbsp;But even though I didn\u2019t find anything, (because let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s more often the case than not), I found it to be a really interesting analysis. Does that ever happen to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p><em>This month a few members of the Data team attended Spark + AI Summit 2018 in San Francisco. In addition to speakers from Databricks, the keynotes featured speakers from a wide variety of industries, including software, car manufacturing, genomics, and even construction. There were over 200 sessions that were organized into tracks, such as developer, data scientist, AI, technical deep dives, and advanced analytics. We\u2019d like to share our favorite sessions with you!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Carly Stambaugh</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-717\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really intrigued by Luis Leal\u2019s talk about Differential Neural Computers. This model, recently developed by Deep Mind, combines the learning capabilities of a neural network with an external memory store. This one ups recurrent neural nets, by dramatically increasing the scale of memory the network can retain. What\u2019s really fascinating about this though, is that the neural net learns how to manage memory storage and retrieval on its own, in a similar manner to how neuroscientists believe a human brain manages memories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first question was whether this model was feasible to implement with limited resources, and Luis said that he built one using two GPUs! You can find <a href=\"https://databricks.com/session/demystifying-differentiable-neural-computers-and-their-brain-inspired-origin\">a video of the talk and a link to the slides on the Databricks website</a>. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Xiao Yu</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/xiaoyu.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/xiaoyu.jpeg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1396\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In working with Data Scientists and Data Engineers at Automattic I&#8217;ve noticed one of our biggest pain points is the mismatch in preferred systems and languages. Data Scientists in general love using Python &#8212; its wide array of tools and libraries makes manipulating and processing data easy. Data Engineers on the other hand, are very adept at working with Java and the JVM as it&#8217;s how most of the distributed systems in the Hadoop universe are built and how clusters are managed. This results in a trade-off for every project we tackle; either use Python with smaller sampled data due to resource constraints of running on a single computer or use Spark to get fast distributed execution across a large cluster but without libraries to do even basic data science.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To bridge this gulf we have tried using PySpark with limited success so I was quite excited by Holden Karau&#8217;s talk <a href=\"https://databricks.com/session/making-pyspark-amazing-from-faster-udfs-to-dependency-management-graphing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Making PySpark Amazing</a> and it did not disappoint. Not only does she summarize the common problems everyone is facing and explains where some of the bottlenecks exist, the talk offers a glimpse into the future and tools (<a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apache Arrow</a>) we can try now to get more useable PySpark performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anand Nayla</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" data-attachment-id=\"2588\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/06/26/reflections-from-spark-ai-summit-2018/anandnayla/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"275,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"anandnayla\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?resize=275%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2588\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/anandnayla.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a data engineer, I&#8217;m always looking to extract more and more value from our Hadoop cluster by increasing cluster utilization by optimizing the jobs running on it. <a href=\"https://databricks.com/session/oversubscribing-apache-spark-resource-usage-for-fun-and\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oversubscribing Apache Spark Resource Usage for Fun and $$$</a> by Sital Kedia and Sergey Makagonov was of particular interest to me as it explains how to play with some of the Spark knobs like <code>spark.task.cpus</code> to close the gap between resources reserved by a job and the actual resource utilization.

His point is that once the dust settles after the hype around ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence (AI), we&#8217;ll realize that what is being called AI is less general purpose intelligence than a collection of powerful tools for augmenting human intelligence (e.g., Siri, what he calls intelligence augmentation or IA) and the intelligent infrastructure (II) that makes these tools possible. There are also some good historical anecdotes in the article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether or not you agree with Jordan&#8217;s point in this piece, I&#8217;d still encourage you to check out the <a href=\"http://www.statsblogs.com/2014/12/30/machine-learning-books-suggested-by-michael-i-jordan-from-berkeley/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reading list</a> he&#8217;s long suggested to his <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/cv.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">post docs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.andrewng.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">grad students</a>, it is a gem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Boris Gorelik</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-716\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> If data visualization isn&#8217;t just a tool for you, I strongly suggest reading &#8220;<a href=\"https://datavizblog.com/2018/04/20/dataviz-as-history-the-travellers-guide-to-madeira-and-the-west-indies-1815/\">Dataviz as history: the traveller\u2019s guide to Madeira and the West Indies (1815)</a>.&#8221; (Although, I would call that post &#8220;Dataviz as a Story.&#8221;) In this post, Michael Sandberg shows a fascinating journey journal from the nineteenth century that was set up as a series of visuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an opinion post, &#8220;<a href=\"https://tombreur.wordpress.com/2018/04/17/are-your-data-scientists-knowledge-alchemists/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Are Your Data Scientists Knowledge Alchemists?</a>&#8221; Tom Breur asks the question that many data scientist and their managers ask themselves again and again: &#8220;Is data science a real thing?&#8221; Unsurprisingly, Tom&#8217;s answer is &#8220;Yes, most of the time.&#8221; Or, in his own words: &#8220;If your data science efforts seem like \u201cAlchemy,\u201d something is going terribly wrong: I have never seen responsible governance for magic.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nabeel Sulieman</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nabeelsulieman.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" data-attachment-id=\"2570\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/04/26/were-reading-about-ai-data-visualization-deep-learning-and-more/nabeelsulieman/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nabeelsulieman.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"275,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"nabeelsulieman\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nabeelsulieman.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nabeelsulieman.jpg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nabeelsulieman.jpg?resize=275%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2570\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nabeelsulieman.jpg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nabeelsulieman.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> I started reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=\"><em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems</em></a>.

Neil Lawrence talks about AI and religion, and Katherine Gorman interviews <a href=\"http://people.csail.mit.edu/beenkim/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Been Kim</a> about interpretability and explainability for neural networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interview with Been Kim starts at 20:30 in the episode and it&#8217;s fascinating. We&#8217;re at a confluence of increased scrutiny of companies&#8217; privacy practices (i.e., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">GDPR</a>), concerns about bias in deployed machine learning (ML) models (which my teammate Charles has <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/10/04/data-speaker-series-charles-earl-on-discriminatory-artificial-intelligence/\" rel=\"nofollow\">spoken and written about</a>), and general anxiety and mistrust of AI as black box, because of its inability or unwillingness to explain itself and its decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These things make interpretability and explainability in ML an important and timely research area, which Been is exploring at Google Brain. She talks about local and global explanations (why was a specific person rejected for a loan, and what kinds of things drive a loan approval classifier in general?), truthfulness of explanations (can an explanation from ML be both easily understood by humans and be actually true at the same time?), and using high level concepts like race and gender as language blocks to craft explanations of a neural network for humans. She emphasizes the importance of evaluation for interpretability methods, and always keeping in mind the end task, whether it&#8217;s a content recommender or a medical diagnosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sirin Odrowski</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/sirin.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/sirin.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-719\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> User experiences that are built on ML or other data-intensive algorithms are no longer a niche; ML is &#8220;a powerful tool for creating personalized and dynamic experiences.&#8221; Recommendation engines help us navigate massive catalogs of content like songs and movies and automatic translation helps us understand foreign languages. Some companies <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/09/18/the-amazing-ways-coca-cola-uses-artificial-intelligence-ai-and-big-data-to-drive-success\" rel=\"nofollow\">use data for product discovery</a> and self-driving cars ask us to trust our safety to algorithms. To build smart products that people enjoy interacting with, we need a holistic understanding of the algorithms, the business opportunity, and the user. &#8220;<a href=\"https://medium.com/google-design/human-centered-machine-learning-a770d10562cd\" rel=\"nofollow\">Human-Centered Machine Learning</a>&#8221; approaches this from a UX designer&#8217;s point of view. For data scientists, it makes an interesting read for a radical change of perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Carly Stambaugh</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-717\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are really effective at solving problems involving sequences. But training an LSTM model is computationally expensive (and can be quite monetarily expensive too, if you&#8217;re paying for cloud computing services!) <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04849\" rel=\"nofollow\">The unreasonable effectiveness of the forget gate</a> introduces JANET, (Just Another Network), that is derived from the principles of an LSTM, but has only a single gate, the forget gate. This single gate network has slightly higher classifications on standard data sets like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database\">MNIST</a>, and requires less computational power! So, it&#8217;s a win-win. I can&#8217;t wait to try this model for my <a href=\"https://data.blog/2018/01/19/to-a-poem-is-a-bott-the-stranger/\" rel=\"nofollow\">poetry bot</a>!

I feel like it gives a good picture of the day-to-day tech stack of our data scientists, and data and software engineers &#8212; though, of course it isn&#8217;t the full picture.

I believe it is a topic that every data scientist will eventually have to make a conscious effort to deal with. So it makes sense that data scientists were at the top of the list when it comes to <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#technology-ai-concerns-by-developer-type\">how much more likely they are to to be concerned about fairness over singularity</a> when it comes to AI (I can&#8217;t even fathom why anyone would be more concerned about science fiction than built-in discriminatory biases, but that is another topic).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1482\" height=\"1124\" data-attachment-id=\"2540\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/03/27/this-week-were-reading-the-2018-stack-overflow-survey/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-14-06-56/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-14-06-56.png?fit=1482%2C1124&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1482,1124\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-16 at 14.06.56\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-14-06-56.png?fit=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-14-06-56.png?fit=1024%2C777&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-14-06-56.png?resize=1482%2C1124&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-16 at 14.06.56\" class=\"wp-image-2540\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-14-06-56.png?w=1482&amp;ssl=1 1482w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-14-06-56.png?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-14-06-56.png?resize=1024%2C777&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-14-06-56.png?resize=768%2C582&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was happy to read that <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#work-do-developers-have-an-obligation-to-consider-the-ethical-implications-of-their-code\">79.6% of respondents believe that developers have an obligation to consider the ethical implications of their code</a>.&nbsp; Of course, when talking about ethics, the question of responsibility comes into play as well. Interestingly, when the question is &#8220;<a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#work-who-is-ultimately-most-responsible-for-code-that-accomplishes-something-unethical\">Who Is

jobs. Developers who belong to gender minorities in tech rank the company culture and office environment as their highest concern when assessing a new job. The gender identification question allowed respondents to select all that apply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of non-male respondents picked company culture and office environment as their highest concern, while the majority of men picked compensation and salary. I found this really interesting. My issue is that the results only show the percentage of people who picked the given item as their <em>top priority</em>. I would be more interested in seeing a weighted ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, it led to some annoying online discussions by people who interpreted the results to mean that for example only 4.3% of women respondents care <em>at all</em> about diversity &#8212; which is not what the results are saying, but the framing is misleading if you don&#8217;t read the descriptions (which we should).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, the survey is an interesting read, I am really glad that Stack Overflow is putting in the time and resources to carry them out. I hope they will make the raw data available like<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/download-stack-overflows-2017-developer-survey-data/\"> they have in the past</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Images in the body of this post are sourced from the 2018 Stack Overflow <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018\">Developer Survey</a>.</em></p>\n",

However, as demonstrated by the above Venn diagram, viewing it as an intersection tends to be too exclusive \u2013 <a href=\"https://yanirseroussi.com/2016/08/04/is-data-scientist-a-useless-job-title/\">in reality, it\u2019s a <i>union</i> of many fields</a>. Hence, data scientists tend to come from various backgrounds, and it is common to encounter data scientists with no formal training in computer science or software engineering. According to Michael Hochster, <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-data-science/answer/Michael-Hochster\">data scientists can be classified into two types</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Type A (analyst): Focused on static data analysis. More of a statistician or a scientist with coding skills than an engineer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Type B (builder): Focused on building data products. More of an engineer with a strong statistical or scientific background than a scientist.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With advanced degrees in areas such as physics, computational chemistry, and mathematics, most of my colleagues at Automattic initially leaned more toward Type A than B. In contrast, I\u2019m a classic Type B, having worked as a software engineer before doing a PhD and becoming a data scientist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Type B data scientists may take for granted best practices from software engineering that are unfamiliar to Type A data scientists. For example, in <a href=\"http://treycausey.com/software_dev_skills.html\">a post on software development skills for data scientists</a>, Trey Causey describes the following imaginary dialogue between a software engineer and a data scientist:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:10%;font-style:italic;\">\nSE: &#8220;You didn&#8217;t check your code and your tests into master without a code review, did you?&#8221;<p></p>\n<p>DS: &#8220;Checked my what into what without a what?&#8221;\n</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While this is an extreme example, it is a good demonstration of the knowledge gaps of new Type A data scientists. Causey lists five engineering skills that data scientists should acquire to start bridging those gaps, but he notes that his list isn\u2019t comprehensive. This is partly because there is no single definition of best practices, and many of them can be seen as obvious or implicit. Nonetheless, since joining Automattic last year, I\u2019ve dedicated some of my time to help increase awareness and adoption of engineering best practices in our data science projects. The rest of this post describes some of the results of this work.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/xkcd-code-quality.png?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1480\" height=\"517\" data-attachment-id=\"2523\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/03/20/engineering-data-science-at-automattic/xkcd-code-quality/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/xkcd-code-quality.png?fit=1480%2C517&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1480,517\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"xkcd-code-quality\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Code quality.

This is useful even for solo projects, as it makes it easy to keep track of development progress, explore different ideas, and revert changes that haven\u2019t gone well. For complex multi-person projects, version control is a strong requirement &#8212; it\u2019s nearly impossible to work effectively without it. Fortunately, Automattic\u2019s data science projects were already under various GitHub repositories when I joined. However, in the past few months we have improved our use of version control in the following ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Started using the <a href=\"https://pre-commit.com/\">pre-commit Python package</a> to check our code locally before it gets committed. The checkers that we use are <a href=\"http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html\">pycodestyle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/latest/\">pydocstyle</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pylint.org/\">Pylint</a>. The former two enforce compliance with some of the guidelines from <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">PEP8</a> and <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/\">PEP257</a> (the official Python style guides for code and documentation, respectively), while the latter detects potential programming errors and ensures adherence to a wide range of coding standards.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up <a href=\"https://circleci.com/\">CircleCI</a> to run the above checkers whenever a pull request is made or code is merged to the master branch. This ensures that even if pre-commit hooks were skipped for some reason (e.g., misconfiguration), errors would be caught. In addition, CircleCI uses <a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/\">pytest</a> to run our tests in an isolated <a href=\"https://conda.io/docs/\">Conda</a> environment that is similar to the environment in which the code is expected to run (e.g., a sandbox that connects to our Hadoop cluster).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increased clarity around code placement by setting up a central data science repository for all our shared code, one-time analyses, notebooks, and various experiments. The only projects that have their own repositories are those that get developed and deployed as standalone tools (e.g., <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/06/12/timeseries-analysis/\">a2f2</a> \u2013 our time series analysis tool).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it easier to <b>share code across projects</b>, we converted our collection of reusable scripts to a private Conda package. Originally, code was sometimes copied to different projects, violating the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\">DRY (<i>don\u2019t repeat yourself</i>) principle</a>. In other cases, the shared code was just assumed to be at a specific local path, which made it hard to reproduce results if the shared code changed in ways that broke the dependent project. With our versioned Conda package, different projects can rely on different package versions, making long-term maintenance easier. We chose Conda rather than <a href=\"https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/\">pip</a> because it allows us to manage the binary dependencies of our projects without making special requests to our system administrators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While our projects handle diverse datasets and address various customer needs, they often end up following similar patterns. For example, all projects accept some data as input, process it, and produce an output (e.g., predictions). Different data scientists working in isolation tend to come up with different directory structures, file names, and identifiers to represent similar concepts. To reduce this divergence and make it easier for us to switch between projects, we have started working towards a <b>standard project structure</b>, inspired by the <a href=\"https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/\">Cookiecutter Data Science template</a>. However, we found that the suggested template doesn\u2019t fully match our needs, so we are in the process of adapting it, and may share the results in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above steps make it easier to perform effective <b>code reviews</b> by reducing ambiguity around conventions and automating the detection of some defects. While code reviews are known to be <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-reviews-just-do-it/\">one of the most effective ways of improving code quality</a>, their benefits extend beyond finding issues in the code that\u2019s being reviewed. Some of those benefits were listed by Kerry Liu (one of Automattic\u2019s JavaScript engineers) in an internal guide to code reviews that is also available as a <a href=\"https://gwwar.com/2017/08/20/code-reviews-%f0%9f%93%9a/\">blog post</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It spreads code ownership.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Communicates changes across teams.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serves as a sanity check to verify that requirements make sense.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allows folks to find bugs through both manual testing and in code.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lets all folks involved learn new things!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can also serve as documentation for how something worked, and why certain decisions were made. Perhaps even for a future you!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to improving the quality of our projects, code reviews and our other efforts in adopting best practices address the main problem identified in Trey Causey\u2019s article &#8212; that \u201c<i>many new data scientists don&#8217;t know how to effectively collaborate.\u201d</i> As with all things that we do, we are committed to <a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/\">never stop learning</a>, and strive to further improve our processes. As noted above, initiatives like our standard project structure still require more work. In addition, we would love to share more of our data science code with the open source community. This is likely to happen as we further improve the modularity of our projects, making it possible to publish generally-useful libraries. Watch this space!</p>\n",

The clip starts by introducing some terminology, and describes how AlphaZero, a more generalized system that can be trained to play any game, uses reinforcement learning to learn these two functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Once you can complete a task <strong>at all</strong>, reinforcement learning provides you with a way to get better at it, just by repeating it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-Fycw6wwl-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/Fycw6wwl?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, Kevin walks through the unique form of tree search that AlphaZero uses, outlining the process by which AlphaZero collects experience.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-KhLAZElC-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/KhLAZElC?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<p>He goes on to describe the training and evaluation process, and closes with some resources for learning more about AlphaZero, encouraging us to learn to play Go!</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-IUNWJ3Ut-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/IUNWJ3Ut?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn More!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Kevin on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/macfergus\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/macfergus</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leela Zero: <a href=\"http://zero.sjeng.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://zero.sjeng.org/</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minigo: <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/minigo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/tensorflow/minigo</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kevin&#8217;s book: <a href=\"https://maxpumperla.github.io/deep_learning_and_the_game_of_go/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://maxpumperla.github.io/deep_learning_and_the_game_of_go/</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Play Go: <a href=\"https://online-go.com/learn-to-play-go\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://online-go.com/learn-to-play-go</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin even gave us a discount code for those interested in purchasing his book from Manning!

This recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html\"><em>New York Times</em> article on bias in face recognition</a> caught my eye/ire. The article highlights work by Joy Buolamwini (MIT) and Timnit Gebru (Microsoft Research) <a href=\"http://gendershades.org/\">described here</a> on the persistent gender and racial bias in artificially intelligent facial recognition. It&#8217;s tiring, really tiring. As if the Big Artificial Intelligence companies (Google, Facebook, etc.) are saying &#8220;Yeah, our artificial intelligence is sexist and racist, deal with it.&#8221; We can take solace that there are phenomenal researchers who just won&#8217;t let it go. That&#8217;s perhaps how change happens anyway.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of artificial intelligence (AI), <a href=\"https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/\">Viktorya Krakovna has a great blog</a> on AI Safety that you should visit.\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Boris Gorelik</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-716\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> I too have two links to share.  In <a href=\"https://learningmltoday.wordpress.com/2018/02/14/the-human-problem-of-machine-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The human problem of machine learning</a>, the blogger says:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\n&#8230;like many market revolutions that have come before it, machine learning (ML) stands to make a lot of people a lot of money. So, granted that, the market must be flooded with newly minted AI experts, right? Actually, that\u2019s not quite the case. In fact, according to this <em>New York Times</em> article, there is a severe shortage of talent, so much so that Google has sponsored a division to create ML programs to, in turn, create ML programs.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That blogger then discusses the issue of supply and demand in machine learning, with several interesting links. For the past few years, I have been living under the assumption that the huge demand for machine learning experts will calm down, as more and more commodity products become available. So far I&#8217;ve been proven wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, AnnMaria De Mars, who holds a Ph.D. in statistics, is a world judo champion and is CEO and a founder of a 7 Generations Games, a company that produces educational games for children.

    "content": "\n<p>At Automattic, we believe that communication is oxygen, and we strive to make our communication as effective as possible. In my last post, &#8220;<a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/08/08/how-communication-density-fuels-automattic/\">How Communication Density Fuels Automattic</a>,&#8221; I introduced Automattic&#8217;s communication tools and explained the positive influence our annual company meeting &#8212; the Grand Meetup &#8212; has on our communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a continuation, this post highlights key results of another study I did around our internal communications, which focused on the flow and consumption of information via our main and most transparent communication device, P2s. As described in <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/08/08/how-communication-density-fuels-automattic/\">my last post</a> about our internal communications, P2s are the backbone of our interactions:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Our main communication platform is, of course, run on WordPress.com. We employ&nbsp;<strong>a network of blogs</strong>&nbsp;called P2s, that run the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://p2theme.com/\">P2 theme</a>. P2s allow us to post right from the blog\u2019s homepage to have real-time, threaded discussions under the posts. We can cross-post to other teams\u2019 P2s, mention other Automatticians by name to notify them of a discussion, like posts, and follow discussions.&nbsp;<strong>Everything is archived and searchable.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Flow of information at a remote company</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are all connected, and working in a distributed environment means that we have enough empirical data to trace these connections; we can answer questions such as,&nbsp;<strong>How do we interact with each other? How many cliques do we form? Who are our bridges and influencers?</strong> More on cliques, bridges, and influencers coming up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Methodology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer these questions, I created the<strong>&nbsp;interaction network of all Automatticians</strong>&nbsp;on all work P2s from the previous year. In the network, all nodes denote an <em>Automattician,&nbsp;</em>which is our internal term for an employee of Automattic. If an Automattician likes or comments on a post authored by one of their colleagues, then there is a directed edge going from them to the author of the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-full wp-image-2395\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"787\" height=\"760\" data-attachment-id=\"2395\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/02/01/analysis-of-a-beautiful-storm-internal-communication-at-automattic/hairball_net/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hairball_net.png?fit=787%2C760&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"787,760\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hairball_net\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hairball_net.png?fit=300%2C290&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hairball_net.png?fit=787%2C760&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hairball_net.png?resize=787%2C760&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"hairball_net\" class=\"wp-image-2395\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hairball_net.png?w=787&amp;ssl=1 787w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hairball_net.png?resize=300%2C290&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hairball_net.png?resize=768%2C742&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A segment of our big and intense communication network depicting who interacted with whom.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clustering the network</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand how many cliques we form, I employed a graph clustering algorithm called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity\">Louvain modularity</a>. This approach helps us identify cliques (<em>modularity groups</em>) in the social network by looking at which groups of nodes are more connected to each other than they are to the rest of the network. Multiple Automatticians belong in the same clique if they interact way more with each other than they do with others. This is depicted in the visualization as the color of the Automattician&#8217;s node.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter alignnone size-full wp-image-221\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"221\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/screen-shot-2017-01-06-at-14-00-17/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screen-shot-2017-01-06-at-14-00-17.png?fit=976%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"976,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"screen-shot-2017-01-06-at-14-00-17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screen-shot-2017-01-06-at-14-00-17.png?fit=300%2C295&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screen-shot-2017-01-06-at-14-00-17.png?fit=976%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/389px-network_community_structure-svg.png\" alt=\"389px-Network_Community_Structure.svg\" class=\"wp-image-221\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Demonstration of network clusters, with three groups of nodes that have strong internal ties, and sparse ties to other groups.

The <b>PageRank </b>algorithm&nbsp;introduces a randomness that makes sure that even less-connected nodes will be considered. In more subjective terms, PageRank says that nodes with higher quality connections are more important than nodes with lower quality connections. Developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to rank search results on Google, this is one of the most widely used methods for identifying influential nodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The network of information flow at Automattic</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-full wp-image-2396\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"4000\" data-attachment-id=\"2396\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/02/01/analysis-of-a-beautiful-storm-internal-communication-at-automattic/full_work_net_anonymized_opacity_up/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/full_work_net_anonymized_opacity_up.png?fit=4000%2C4000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4000,4000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"full_work_net_anonymized_opacity_up\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Interaction network of Automattic employees.

(At Automattic, we are so connected that it would have been impossible to interpret the full network in any meaningful way without rigorous filtering. It would look like a massive hair ball.

Looking into who is connected to whom, we can see that&nbsp;<strong>we are more of a project-based company</strong>&nbsp;than a team-based one. While our team connections are strong, they are not necessarily stronger than our intra-team interactions. This was concluded via manual inspection where we note people from different teams being on the same cluster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This network clearly shows us that&nbsp;<strong>we are a centralized company, centered around the CEO</strong> &#8212; besides PageRank, Matt ranked the highest in interactions (more incoming rather than outgoing), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality\">betweenness centrality</a>, meaning that he is our top bridge/connector &#8212; most information passes through him &#8212; and in number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Degree_centrality\">overall connections</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we also see a few influential nodes in each cluster, and<strong>&nbsp;strongly connected clusters with their own \u201cleaders\u201d</strong>&nbsp;show that while we are centered around Matt, each cluster also sets its own influencer for team and project-based discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>In an increasingly turbulent business environment where companies need to act fast, a purely decentralized innovation model won\u2019t suffice. What is needed is an exact combination of knowledge and power among the rank and file, and the right level of power stems from corporate leaders. This doesn\u2019t make the case for micro-management or corporate interference. But there are times when strategic intervention from the very top can prove critical. \u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.imd.org/publications/articles/google-vs-amazon-how-a-strong-ceo-boosts-innovation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noreferrer\">\u201c</a></em><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.imd.org/publications/articles/google-vs-amazon-how-a-strong-ceo-boosts-innovation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noreferrer\">Google vs Amazon: How a Strong CEO Boosts Innovation</a>&#8221; (International&nbsp;Institute for Management Development)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At Automattic, we work in a very autonomous manner. It is at first a little surprising to newcomers, however, as this and similar internal analyses have shown, we all strive to be connected and make our work discussions visible and transparent to the rest of the company via P2 blogs for teams and projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A network analysis like this also gives us opportunities to figure out how to best inform everyone of big changes in a fast way, whether our communication structure is robust enough to account for people taking longer leaves, or what the characteristics of above-average communicators at our company are. These are all things we have looked into, stay tuned for subsequent posts on our HR analyses!</p>\n",

I decided to turn this phrase around and ask, <em>Can I make poetry with code?</em> Could I make a bot that could write original poetry? I created an experiment to find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, I knew that if my bot was to learn to write poetry, it first had to read poetry. In 2017, authors used WordPress to publish over half a million posts <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/tag/poetry\">tagged as poetry</a>. I reached out to some prolific poets sharing their work with WordPress and asked if they&#8217;d be willing to collaborate with me on a fun experiment: would they allow my bot to read their work so that it could learn about poetic form and structure, so that it might learn to write its own poetry? Special thanks to these intrepid writers who collaborated for the sake of science!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://robertokaji.com/\"> O at the Edges</a> &#8211; Robert Okaji</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"http://wolffpoetry.com/\">Wolff Poetry</a> &#8211; Linda J.

For instance, suppose you were training a neural network to recognize a square. One layer might be responsible for identifying right angles, and another might recognize parallel lines. Both of these qualities must be present in order for the image to be a square. The neural network learns the qualities necessary by training on millions of images of squares. It learns what aspects of the image are important to recognizing a square, and those that aren&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now suppose you are using a neural network to predict the next letter in this sequence:</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">th_</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>As a human, this task is pretty straightforward. Chances are, you guessed <em>e</em>, but I&#8217;ll bet that, if you are an English speaker, you didn&#8217;t guess <em>q</em>. That&#8217;s because you&#8217;ve learned that&nbsp;<em>th</em> is not followed by <em>q</em> in the English language. The preceding letters are extremely relevant to predicting what comes next. An LSTM can &#8220;remember&#8221; its previous state to inform its current decision. For a more in-depth explanation of how an LSTM works, check out <a href=\"http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/\">this excellent post</a> by Chris Olah, of Google Brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many LSTM text-generation examples, my bot generates text by producing one character at a time. So to put words together in any meaningful fashion, it must first learn how to make words. To achieve this, it needs millions of example sequences that contain valid words. It&#8217;s a good thing WordPress.com has plenty of poetry!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Preparing the data set</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I started by pulling all of the poetry from the sites listed above from our Elasticsearch index. I stripped out everything but the text of the poem, using a very simple rule, based on the number of words per <code>\\n</code> character. If a block of text contains many words but few <code>\\n</code> characters, this is likely to be a collection of one or more paragraphs. However, a block of text with words spread across many lines is more likely to be a poem. This is a simplistic method, for sure, and I can think of plenty of great poems that would fail this test! But for the purposes of this experiment I was specifically interested in whether the LSTM could learn about structure, like line breaks and stanzas, and other poetic devices such as rhyme, assonance, consonance, and alliteration. So, restricting the training data to fairly structured poetry made sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a block of text was determined to be a poem, I wrote it out to a text file, prefixing it with <code>++++\\n</code> to indicate the start of a new poem. This resulted in about 500KB of training data. Usually, I try to use at least 1MB of text to train an LSTM, so I needed to find more poetry! To supplement the featured poets, I used a random sample of public posts tagged poetry published in the last year. This is similar to what you might discover if you follow the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/tag/poetry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poetry tag in the WordPress.com Reader</a>. I limited the random poetry to one post per author.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Training the LSTM network</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I had over 1 MB of poetry, I began building an LSTM network. I use the Python library <a href=\"https://github.com/keras-team/keras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keras</a> for all my neural network needs, and the keras GitHub repo has <a href=\"https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dozens of example scripts</a> to help you learn to work with several different types of neural nets, including one for <a href=\"https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py\">text generation using LSTMs</a>. I modelled my code after this example, and began experimenting with different model configurations. The goal of the model is to produce original poetry. In this case, overfitting &#8212; or learning the training data too specifically so the model doesn&#8217;t generalize &#8212; could result in generating text that too closely resembles the input text. (Which would be like plagiarism, and no poet likes that!) One way to prevent overfitting is to add dropout to your network. This forces a random subset of weights at each step to drop to zero. This is kind of like forcing the network to &#8220;forget&#8221; some of what it just learned. (I also added extra post processing checks to prevent poets&#8217; work from being reproduced by the bot.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://www.floydhub.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FloydHub</a>\u2019s GPUs to do the heavy lifting of training my network. This allowed me to train the network about 10 times as fast as with my laptop. My first network featured a single LSTM layer followed by a dropout&nbsp;layer. This resulted in text that certainly looked like poetry! It had line breaks and stanzas, and nearly all of the character combinations were actual words. Occasionally entire lines were slightly coherent. In fact, that first iteration produced this gem:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"830\" height=\"282\" data-attachment-id=\"2368\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/01/19/to-a-poem-is-a-bott-the-stranger/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-1-52-14-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-1-52-14-pm.png?fit=830%2C282&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"830,282\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-19 at 1.52.14 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-1-52-14-pm.png?fit=300%2C102&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-1-52-14-pm.png?fit=830%2C282&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-1-52-14-pm.png?resize=830%2C282&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-19 at 1.52.14 PM\" class=\"wp-image-2368\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-1-52-14-pm.png?w=830&amp;ssl=1 830w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-1-52-14-pm.png?resize=300%2C102&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-1-52-14-pm.png?resize=768%2C261&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I added LSTM layers, experimenting with the dropout level within each layer until settling on the final model below.

Spikes! What&#8217;s that all about?? <a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/303857/explanation-of-spikes-in-training-loss-vs-iterations-with-adam-optimizer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turns out that this happens pretty commonly</a> when using the <code>adam</code> optimizer. Notice that as I added LSTM layers to the network, the validation loss for the model continued to decrease overall, and at a faster rate. This means viable results in fewer epochs, but the additional layers increase the training time per epoch. Training with a single LSTM layer took about 600 seconds per epoch, finishing overnight.&nbsp;However, three LSTM layers needed 7000 seconds per epoch, which took several days to complete training. So, the faster drop in validation loss doesn&#8217;t actually mean faster results. Even though it took longer to train, the poetry generated by the three LSTM layer network was, in my completely subjective opinion, better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Generating poetry</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To produce wholly original text, I also needed to change the way the text was generated. In the keras library example, the script selects a random sequence of characters from the training data as input to the trained network as a seed. I want a bot that writes its own poetry, not one that finishes other poets&#8217; prompts! So, I experimented with different seedings of the text generation step.&nbsp; Since I had begun each poem in the training set with <code>++++\\n&nbsp;</code>, I thought this would suffice to create wholly original output. But the results were a nonsensical combination of <code>\\n</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>.</code>, and <code>&amp;</code>. After some trial and error, I figured out that the seed sequence needed to have the same number of characters as the training sequences. It seems obvious in hindsight! Ultimately, I used a sequence of 300 characters,&nbsp; so I seeded the generation step by repeating <code>++++\\n&nbsp;</code> for exactly 300 characters.&nbsp; The bot was able to generate several poems per round by occasionally separating the text with <code>++++\\n</code>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the script generated a new round of poetry, I performed the final plagiarism check. To do this, I first created the set of all unique 4-grams (phrases containing four words) within the training set, and did the same for my bot&#8217;s poetry. Then I calculated the intersection of these two sets. For the purposes of this experiment, I manually inspected the 4-grams to make sure that the phrases that appeared in both sets were inane. Typically, this intersection consisted of things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>i do n&#8217;t want</li>\n\n\n\n<li>i can not be</li>\n\n\n\n<li>i want to be</li>\n\n\n\n<li>the sound of the</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I repeated this process using 5 and 6-grams for good measure. If I were to automate this process, I would probably take a frequency-based approach, and exclude n-grams commonly found across multiple authors from being considered plagiarized.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The poetry!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Outputting the model weights after each epoch means we can load a snapshot of the model at several points during its training.&nbsp;Looking into the early epochs of the final model, it&#8217;s clear that the bot picked up on line breaks right away. I expected this, given that by design, the most prominent characteristic of the training data is few characters per line. Here&#8217;s an example of a poem generated after one epoch of training:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The pare of frowning the wand the sallt a merien</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will we mece wore and and the bite</p>\n\n\n\n<p>in is what to call stor the mathing all your bray</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s already learned some actual words, and mimics the common practice of empty space between each line. From far away, if you don&#8217;t squint too hard, that looks like a poem! After the single LSTM model&#8217;s loss converged, the model had learned stanzas as well as line breaks, and even shows some of the common poetic device repetition.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The and the beautiful specting<br>\nThe flight of how the way<br>\nI am the room of the words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have seen to see<br>\nBut your heart will see the face</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The strong suit of the single LSTM model was definitely in individual lines.&nbsp; Aside from the title line, another one of my favorites is:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>the wind is only for me</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the spirit of the ever hilarious <a href=\"http://inspirobot.me/\">Inspirobot,</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://data.blog/author/dem0sh/\">Demet</a> made this gem from one of her favorite lines:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"360\" height=\"202\" data-attachment-id=\"2436\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/01/19/to-a-poem-is-a-bott-the-stranger/sun_360/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sun_360.jpg?fit=360%2C202&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"360,202\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"sun_360\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sun_360.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sun_360.jpg?fit=360%2C202&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sun_360.jpg?resize=360%2C202&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"sun_360\" class=\"wp-image-2436\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sun_360.jpg?w=360&amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sun_360.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas the single LSTM model didn&#8217;t quite master theme within a poem, it did seem to have a common thread throughout the full body of work that it produced.

For example,</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>there&#8217;s a part of the world<br>\nbetween the darkness</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>the shadows stay the day</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoa, that&#8217;s deep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, we&#8217;ve seen lines, stanzas, rhyme (both internal and at the end of lines), repetition, and alliteration. Not bad! But, occasional dramatic flair aside, the poems the bot produces at this point are generally incoherent collections of words. For the most part, there isn&#8217;t even grammatical structure to its nonsense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This begins to change though, with the addition of a third LSTM layer. This model is much more likely to produce lines that are grammatically sound, even if still nonsensical. For instance:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The father of the light is not a fist of the bones</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This sentence doesn&#8217;t make sense, but it has properly placed the parts of speech. It also has alliteration, and a general poetic feel to the noun clauses.&nbsp;The triple-layer LSTM model also produced these lines, that I think are pretty solid, poetically speaking:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The world was a butterfly land</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I feel the mistake alone</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But the crowning achievement of the triple layered LSTM model is this complete poem.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>From your heart of the darkness<br>\nI stay<br>\nand struggle on the soul</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not an excerpt from a larger chunk of text. These lines were positioned firmly between two <code>++++\\n</code> delimiters.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"249\" data-attachment-id=\"2454\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2018/01/19/to-a-poem-is-a-bott-the-stranger/mind_blown_david_tennant/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mind_blown_david_tennant.gif?fit=500%2C249&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,249\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"mind_blown_david_tennant\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mind_blown_david_tennant.gif?fit=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mind_blown_david_tennant.gif?fit=500%2C249&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mind_blown_david_tennant.gif?resize=500%2C249&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"mind_blown_david_tennant\" class=\"wp-image-2454\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well folks, humanity&#8217;s been fun.

Or you can start a blog.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Methodology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before answering these questions, we need to make several decisions. For example, do we want to include spammers in our analysis? Sure, one\u2019s New Year&#8217;s resolution might be \u201cspam more to get more money.\u201d However, since most of us dislike spammers, and Automattic, the company that hosts WordPress.com, actively chases spammers, we will exclude them from this analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was an easy decision. What about people who create a blog, and lose the motivation to update it the day after registration? Sounds like a clear \u201cexclude\u201d decision, right? What about one week? One month? How long should we wait before we decide that a blog is no longer active? Is one month enough? Not always. What about a year? A year sounds like too long for most of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, there are many unsolved questions that need to be answered before addressing the question that really interests us. Luckily, in a comparison study like this one, applying reasonable decisions to all the analysis groups reduces the effect of the arbitrary choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, do blogs registered around a new year have higher chances of surviving longer? To answer these questions, we looked at WordPress.com blogs that are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Public.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don\u2019t host spam or mature content.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do not belong to the <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com VIP</a> program.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have <code>language_id</code> set to <code>English</code>. Since New Year&#8217;s resolutions are a cultural phenomenon, we&#8217;ll only concentrate on an English-speaking segment of WordPress.com.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For which the difference between the \u201clast updated\u201d and the \u201cregistered\u201d dates was at least seven days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we need to set the criteria that indicates an abandoned blog and pinpoint the time at which that happened. Again, we have to rely on arbitrary decisions. For the purpose of this analysis, a blog updated at least once during the last 60 days is considered to be an active blog. If the blog has not been updated in the last 60 days, we consider the date of the last update as the blog\u2019s date of abandonment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Results</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll separate the entire population into two groups and track the \u201csurvival curve\u201d of the blogs in our study. In the \u201cNew Year&#8217;s resolution&#8221; group, are all the blogs that were registered one week before or after a new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1365\" height=\"547\" data-attachment-id=\"2374\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/12/26/do-new-years-resolutions-work-data-suggests-they-do/figure_003_new-year-resolutions-work_/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/figure_003_new-year-resolutions-work_.png?fit=1365%2C547&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,547\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"blogger survival\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/figure_003_new-year-resolutions-work_.png?fit=300%2C120&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/figure_003_new-year-resolutions-work_.png?fit=1024%2C410&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/figure_003_new-year-resolutions-work_.png?resize=1365%2C547&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Graph showing survival curves of two groups of blogs.

Some research suggests that public commitment (such as a New Year&#8217;s resolution) is an effective way to ensure persistence. The truth is that you will never know. On the other hand, the only certain way to fail is not to try at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to put your New Year&#8217;s blogging resolution in place? <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">Sign up</a> and get started today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><small>Omphaloskepsis image by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/greggman/4305490456/in/photolist-7ysLj5-a5Vsnw-hGT6T-hGT8v\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gregg Tavares</a> under CC-BY 2.0. cropped</small></p>\n",

Highlights include <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2016/09/21/what-has-happened-down-here-is-the-winds-have-changed/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andrew Gelman&#8217;s timeline of changes in the field</a>, <a href=\"https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2017/02/02/reconstruction-of-a-train-wreck-how-priming-research-went-of-the-rails/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schimmack, Heene, and Kesavan&#8217;s overview of problems with priming research</a>, focusing on studies selected for Kahneman&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> (which is still worth reading, despite <a href=\"https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2017/02/02/reconstruction-of-a-train-wreck-how-priming-research-went-of-the-rails/comment-page-1/#comment-1454\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kahneman&#8217;s acceptance of the conclusions of the article</a>), and various <a href=\"http://datacolada.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Data Colada</a> posts, including <a href=\"http://datacolada.org/66\" rel=\"nofollow\">a recent one that demonstrates how even meta-analyses can go wrong</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be discouraging to know that so many peer-reviewed studies are invalid, but it&#8217;s great to see that researchers are moving toward more rigorous testing of previously-accepted findings. While all people should avoid jumping to conclusions from insufficient evidence, this is especially relevant to data practitioners &#8212; we must be extra careful, because it&#8217;s very easy to unintentionally mislead others with data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Boris Gorelik</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-716\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> Why can&#8217;t you divide by zero? Why does the factorial of 0 equal 1? What&#8217;s so special about the number 78557? If you, your brother, sister or grand-uncle love numbers but lack the formal math degree, show them this wonderful YouTube channel called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A\">Numberphile</a> &#8212; a channel that hosts short professionally made &#8220;videos about numbers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why does adding more evidence for a particular case decrease our confidence in that case? In the 2016 paper &#8220;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00900\">Too good to be true: when overwhelming evidence fails to convince</a>,&#8221; Lachlan J. Gunn and his co-authors start with citing an ancient Talmudic law that requires that one can not be unanimously convicted of a capital crime. They proceed to Bayesian statistics to show how adding unanimous evidence should reduce our confidence, and raise the suspicion of bias:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-14-at-21-45-22.png?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"698\" height=\"744\" data-attachment-id=\"2352\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/12/19/were-reading-about-artificially-intelligent-harry-potter-fan-fiction-verifying-online-identities-and-more/screen-shot-2017-12-14-at-21-45-22/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-14-at-21-45-22.png?fit=698%2C744&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"698,744\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"screen-shot-2017-12-14-at-21-45-22\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-14-at-21-45-22.png?fit=281%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-14-at-21-45-22.png?fit=698%2C744&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-14-at-21-45-22.png?resize=698%2C744&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2352\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-14-at-21-45-22.png?w=698&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-14-at-21-45-22.png?resize=281%2C300&amp;ssl=1 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Robert Elliott</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" data-attachment-id=\"2228\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/10/17/were-reading-about-bias-in-ai-spacex-and-more/robertelliott/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"275,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"RobertElliott\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?resize=275%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2228\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> I&#8217;ve been reading about the <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/we-are-uncovering-more-fake-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-that-suggest-large-scale-244c900f5043\" rel=\"nofollow\">continued efforts to subvert democracy through fake pro-repeal Net Neutrality comments</a>. We need to start thinking about how we can verify that someone is a real person online. I&#8217;ve been following <a href=\"https://www.civic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Civic</a>, a startup using blockchain to control and protect online identities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was also reading about how <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-bot-politic\" rel=\"nofollow\">artificial intelligence (A.I.) systems pretending to be female are often subjected to the same sorts of online harassment as women</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, of course, I was reading more about Alpha<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">Go</span>Zero&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609736/alpha-zeros-alien-chess-shows-the-power-and-the-peculiarity-of-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">foray into chess</a> and how flabbergasted Grand Masters (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiJeP9oifsc\" rel=\"nofollow\">#</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxtEDLpJoqQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">#</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEBMLlIPuM\" rel=\"nofollow\">#</a>) around the world are reacting to AlphaZero&#8217;s peculiar genius.

Last week <a href=\"http://about.botnik.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Botnik</a> released some Harry Potter fan fiction generated by a predictive text algorithm. It&#8217;s pretty fantastic! Check out <a href=\"http://botnik.org/content/harry-potter.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s plenty of fantastic one liners such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Ron&#8217;s Ron shirt was just as bad as Ron himself</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The password was &#8220;BEEF WOMEN,&#8221; Hermione cried.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am particularly impressed by the continuity across pairs of sentences. For example,</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Harry tore his eyes from his head and threw them into the forest. Voldemort raised his eyebrows at Harry, who could not see anything at the moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>To Harry, Ron was a loud, slow, and soft bird. Harry did not like to think about birds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you read something great in the data science field recently? Be sure to share your links with us in the comments.</p>\n",

Today, there are hundreds of TLDs available on the net, including .blog, which is almost one year old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do people choose the TLD for their domain name? Are there words people more closely associate with a .com TLD than with the .org? What about .blog, which is the second-most popular TLD registered with WordPress.com?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer these questions, we checked domain name mappings created between October 1, 2016 and October 1, 2017. The following figure shows the registration dynamics during the period. Note the registration peak in January.

To analyze keyword affinity to the different TLDs, I used a dictionary-based word segmenter to split a domain name into its potential components. For example, using this segmenter, \u201cbeerlover\u201d becomes <code>[\u201cbeer\u201d,\u201clover\u201d]</code>. Currently, the segmenter is based on English and is not aware of many proper names. Thus, segmenting my personal blog site, <a href=\"https://gorelik.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://gorelik.net</a> results in <code>[\u201cgore\u201d,\u201clik\u201d]</code>. For the purpose of this analysis, dictionary-based segmentation is sufficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that, among the popular TLDs, the one with the fewest components (tokens) is the newest one \u2014 .blog, which is represented by the blue line in the figure below. The .com TLD (black line) is so saturated, that people are forced to select longer, more complex domain names, evidenced by the higher peaks at the three, four, five, and six tokens per a domain name.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"672\" height=\"482\" data-attachment-id=\"2335\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/12/12/doing-the-math-on-key-words-and-top-level-domains/keyword-tld-association-03/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-03.png?fit=672%2C482&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"672,482\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"keyword-tld-association-03\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-03.png?fit=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-03.png?fit=672%2C482&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-03.png?resize=672%2C482&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"keyword-tld-association-03\" class=\"wp-image-2335\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-03.png?w=672&amp;ssl=1 672w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-03.png?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To compute the probability of TLD given a token <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"t\" class=\"latex\" />, we use the Multinomial Naive Bayes approach as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28d%7Ct%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BN_%7Bd%2Ct%7D+%2B+%5Calpha%7D%7BN_T+%2B+%5Calpha%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"P(d|t) = &#92;frac{N_{d,t} + &#92;alpha}{N_T + &#92;alpha}\" class=\"latex\" /> ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>where <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"N_T\" class=\"latex\" /> is the number of TLD appearances in the data set, <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"n\" class=\"latex\" /> is the number of unique tokens, and <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"&#92;alpha\" class=\"latex\" /> is a smoothing factor. In our computations, we set <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"&#92;alpha=&#92;frac{1}{n}\" class=\"latex\" />. You may read more about the Multinomial Naive Bayes <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on this page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For easier computation using very small numbers, we compute the affinity score as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28d%7Ct%29+%3D+%5Clog+%5Cleft+%28+P%28d%7Ct%29+%5Cright+%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"S(d|t) = &#92;log &#92;left ( P(d|t) &#92;right )\" class=\"latex\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Most discriminative token</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, some keywords will not have a preference to any given TLD. One would expect to find very common words such as \u201cthe,\u201d \u201cand,\u201d \u201cof,\u201d \u201ca,\u201d and others among such non-discriminative keywords. We excluded such words from our analysis. To identify the keywords that have a strong preference toward one of the top four TLDs (.com, .blog, .org, .net), I computed the mean absolute deviation of the <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28d%7Ct%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"S(d|t)\" class=\"latex\" /> values (MAD) for each token. Next, I sorted all the tokens using the MAD values&nbsp;and kept only the tokens that appear 1,000 times or more in the data set. Finally, I performed k-Nearest Neighbour clustering (k=3) on the resulting values. The following figure shows the preference scores of most 35 discriminative tokens, colored by the cluster.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"739\" height=\"456\" data-attachment-id=\"2336\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/12/12/doing-the-math-on-key-words-and-top-level-domains/keyword-tld-association-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-04.png?fit=739%2C456&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"739,456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"keyword-tld-association-04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-04.png?fit=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-04.png?fit=739%2C456&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-04.png?resize=739%2C456&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"keyword-tld-association-04\" class=\"wp-image-2336\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-04.png?w=739&amp;ssl=1 739w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-04.png?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we see, most of the preference variability happens in the .blog TLD. Thus, tokens most related to the .blog TLD are &#8220;site,&#8221; &#8220;that,&#8221; &#8220;com,&#8221; &#8220;faith,&#8221; &#8220;style,&#8221; &#8220;fashion,&#8221; &#8220;science,&#8221; &#8220;girl,&#8221; &#8220;its,&#8221; &#8220;adventures,&#8221; &#8220;code,&#8221; and &#8220;hope.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tokens less related to .blog are &#8220;lab,&#8221; &#8220;academy,&#8221; &#8220;services,&#8221; &#8220;solutions,&#8221; &#8220;inc,&#8221; &#8220;productions,&#8221; &#8220;llc,&#8221; &#8220;center,&#8221; &#8220;church,&#8221; and &#8220;blog.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is interesting to note the appearance of the \u201cblog\u201d token in the \u201cnon-blog\u201d group. Maybe it\u2019s about time to switch to the .blog domain?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Most discriminative TLD</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly to how different tokens can show different preference to different TLDs, some TLDs are more sensitive to keywords than others. To examine this aspect, I computed TLD-wise MAD values for all the tokens that appear in our dataset 100 times or more. I also extended the TLDs that I analyzed to other language-neutral domains: .com, .blog, .org, .net, and also .co, .live, .info, and .online. I did not include country specific domains, as those results are expected to be influenced by different language characteristics.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"423\" height=\"646\" data-attachment-id=\"2337\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/12/12/doing-the-math-on-key-words-and-top-level-domains/keyword-tld-association-05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-05.png?fit=423%2C646&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"423,646\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"keyword-tld-association-05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-05.png?fit=196%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-05.png?fit=423%2C646&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-05.png?resize=423%2C646&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"keyword-tld-association-05\" class=\"wp-image-2337\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-05.png?w=423&amp;ssl=1 423w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/keyword-tld-association-05.png?resize=196%2C300&amp;ssl=1 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The figure above shows domain name discrimination, as measured by MAD values for the tested domains. The categories are sorted according to the TLD prevalence in the data set. On one hand, we can see that the \u201cspecial\u201d TLDs are much more sensitive to the keyword. On the other hand, the strong correlation between the TLD rank and the MAD value suggests that this apparent sensitivity is a result of different sample sizes \u2014 the more popular a TLD is, the more it is sensitive to extreme values, and the higher the computed MAD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that the results that you see here are descriptive. In other words, they don\u2019t prescribe what name to choose for your site, they only describe the current situation, and give some food for thought. They also serve as a reminder that if you have a personal site but not a personal domain name, it is a good idea to <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/domains/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">register one</a> with a TLD of your choice.</p>\n",

He reveals that the goal of his writing has always been to &#8220;simplify without distortion.&#8221; This interview reminded me of the (EXCELLENT) blog &#8220;<a href=\"https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Math with Bad Drawings</a>&#8221; by Ben Orlin, a math teacher from&nbsp;Birmingham, England. At his blog, Ben Orlin does exactly that: He simplifies without distorting. I highly suggest following this blog. At the bare minimum, read the latest post, &#8220;<a href=\"https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2017/10/18/5-ways-to-troll-your-neural-network/\" rel=\"nofollow\">5 Ways to Troll Your Neural Network</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know of other blogs that educate readers about mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and other, related fields? Share your favorites in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Carly Stambaugh</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-717\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> In image classification tasks, an adversarial example is one that has been altered in small ways which are imperceptible to the human eye, in a targeted manner with the intention of &#8220;fooling&#8221; the classifier. Over at labsix, they&#8217;ve <a href=\"http://www.labsix.org/physical-objects-that-fool-neural-nets/\">generated 3D adversarial objects</a> that are consistently misclassified from multiple angles, such as a turtle that is classified as a rifle, no matter which way you turn it. While this may seem hilarious at first, I assure you it&#8217;s actually terrifying.</p>\n",

Shaun is the Interim Head of Marketing at <a href=\"https://www.joinhonor.com/\">Honor</a>, a home care company based in San Francisco, CA. But, before stepping into the role, he was a data scientist. This makes him uniquely suited to share some fun and interesting marketing challenges and common pitfalls marketing teams often encounter when analyzing data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaun talked about his long and winding journey from software engineer to data scientist, to his current marketing position. Starting out as a backend engineer, Shaun&#8217;s first foray into machine learning came when he detected a bot net interfering with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meebo\">Meebo&#8217;s</a> ad network. Faced with eliminating said bot net, Shaun started on his path to becoming a data scientist. After Meebo, he continued fraud detection and prevention at Google, before leaving to start a home care company, Honor. At first, as a developer and data scientist, Shaun worked on fun and fascinating logistics problems, before his SEO knowledge helped him become the head of marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this clip, he discusses a bit of marketing&#8217;s history, and introduces data challenges in the field.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-O16eeGev-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/O16eeGev?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lifetime Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaun spoke about customer lifetime value (LTV) and highlighted a subtle, yet commonly overlooked characteristic of the metric. Often, marketers will try to model LTV by using the average of existing customer lifetimes. Here, he discusses the bias this method introduces and explains the <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.510.5317&amp;rank=1\">problem of censored data</a>, giving some advice on how to appropriately model LTV.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-ZTxfQEmN-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ZTxfQEmN?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Net Promoter Scores</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, Shaun talked about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter\">net promoter scores</a> (NPS). These scores are based on survey results, and thus come with their own set of challenges, which he discusses in the following clip. He talks about the classic statistics problem of <a href=\"http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/confint.htm\">confidence interval </a>estimation, and reminds us that &#8220;data scientists are statisticians with better marketing.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-i3RgcRnY-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/i3RgcRnY?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Shaun discusses the challenges of applying the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control#Controlled_experiments\">traditional experimental set up </a>within the advertising space, by contrasting it with the more straightforward A/B testing scenario.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-4SoW4jcA-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='224' src='https://videopress.com/embed/4SoW4jcA?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested in catching up on our Data Speaker series?

First, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/abandon.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Abandon statistical significance</a>,&#8221; by McShane et al., is a well-written argument against the cult of p-values. As anyone who has seriously looked into the matter knows, a result can be statistically significant but nonsensical, or not statistically significant and valid. It&#8217;s time to look at the full body of evidence rather than focus on arbitrary thresholds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, &#8220;<a href=\"https://brohrer.github.io/imposter_syndrome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Imposter syndrome</a>&#8221; by Brandon Rohrer discusses the meaning of being a <em>real</em> data scientist. In his words: &#8220;Our goal isn\u2019t to accumulate answers, but to ask better questions. If you are asking questions and using data to find answers, YOU ARE A DATA SCIENTIST.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Robert Elliott</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" data-attachment-id=\"2228\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/10/17/were-reading-about-bias-in-ai-spacex-and-more/robertelliott/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"275,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"RobertElliott\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?fit=275%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?resize=275%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2228\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?w=275&amp;ssl=1 275w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robertelliott.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> I&#8217;ve got three pieces I&#8217;d like to share. In the first piece, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608986/forget-killer-robotsbias-is-the-real-ai-danger/?utm_source=Benedict%27s+newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=9e422fccac-Benedict%27s+Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_4999ca107f-9e422fccac-70655297\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forget Killer Robots\u2014Bias Is the Real AI Danger,</a>&#8221; &#8220;John Giannandrea, who leads AI at Google, is worried about intelligent systems learning human prejudices.&#8221; The article talks about <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/10/04/data-speaker-series-charles-earl-on-discriminatory-artificial-intelligence/\">the importance of removing bias</a> from training data and in building less opaque/black-boxed models. Giannandrea also doesn&#8217;t believe that any kind of super-human computer intelligence is about to take over the world anytime soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second piece is by Lars Blackmore, the principal rocket landing engineer at SpaceX. Entitled,  &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nae.edu/19582/Bridge/164237/164334.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Autonomous Precision Landing of Space Rockets</a>,&#8221; Lars describes how he and his team are using <a href=\"https://cvxgen.com/docs/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CVXGEN (fast convex optimization problem solver)</a> to generate customized flight code, which enables very high-speed onboard convex optimization. Learn more about it in the video below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"CRS-10 | Falcon 9 First Stage Landing\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/glEvogjdEVY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The third piece talks about how DeepMind&#8217;s WaveNet is <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant\" rel=\"nofollow\"> now being used to generate the voice of the Google Assistant in US English and Japanese</a>. It is becoming really tough to tell the difference between a human and artificial voice!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Demet Dagdelen</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/demet.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/demet.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-718\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> I enjoyed this piece by Kashmir Hill, called &#8220;<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-outs-sex-workers-1818861596\" rel=\"nofollow\">How Facebook Outs Sex Workers</a>.&#8221; The article describes how Facebook users who might want to keep their identities private can be outed by the platform&#8217;s People You May Know feature. One of the worrying aspects of the feature (besides not being opt-in) is that the company does not explain what data it uses to make these suggestions. The ramifications of the feature, as described in the article, can be an issue of life and death for anyone from sex workers to political activists or the LGBT communities, especially in oppressive and conservative countries where Facebook usage is still widespread. This also <em>potentially</em> ties in with the new EU regulation surrounding data protection and its &#8220;<a href=\"https://iapp.org/news/a/is-there-a-right-to-explanation-for-machine-learning-in-the-gdpr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">right to explanation</a>&#8221; component.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Krista Stevens</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristastevens1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-attachment-id=\"2236\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/10/17/were-reading-about-bias-in-ai-spacex-and-more/kristastevens/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristastevens1.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"150,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"KristaStevens\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristastevens1.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristastevens1.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristastevens1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2236\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> I came across this piece on how <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/spotifys-discover-weekly-how-machine-learning-finds-your-new-music-19a41ab76efe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify uses machine learning</a> to create your Discover weekly playlist. I&#8217;ve been happily shocked by what shows up on this list week to week. I often find myself asking, <em>How the heck does it know?!?!</em> Now, I know.  The piece looks at the different ways in which music services have done curation over the years and how Spotify has built on and improved earlier methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p><em>&#8220;I will never stop learning&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> is the first line of our <a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creed</a></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. To create learning opportunities, we\u2019re inviting speakers to share their insights in our new Data Speaker Series. In the first installment in the series, <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/08/15/data-speaker-series-thorsten-dietzsch-on-building-data-products-at-zalando/\">Thorsten Dietzsch spoke to us on building data products at Zalando</a>. Today, one of our own, Charles Earl, shares how to address bias in machine learning models. Enjoy!</span></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this month&#8217;s Data Speaker Series, I gave a talk &#8212; entitled <i>Learning to be Fair</i> &#8212; describing how gender, racial, and ethnic biases can creep into machine learning models as well as approaches to addressing these biases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Making the web a better place</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Automattic, <a href=\"https://automattic.com\">we are passionate about making the web a better place</a>. We are currently looking at the role Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning might play in achieving that goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the web, while machine learning has given us better tools for <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/\">communication</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/02/ai-is-changing-the-technology-behind-google-searches/\">knowledge discovery</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream\">creative expression</a>, there is by now a banality to the gender and racial bias apparent in so many AI systems. From predatory lending, to exclusionary facial recognition systems, to openly racist chat-bots, discriminatory AI is a far cry from the \u201cbetter place\u201d that Automattic envisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this talk, I hoped to jump start the conversation about how we can identify and build inclusive AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Discriminatory AI in the Wild</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bias shows up in four important application categories: search, machine vision, decision support, and natural language processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Harvard researcher Latanya Sweeney noticed that Google searches for racially associated personal names would give higher ranking to ads suggesting criminal history. <a href=\"https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/onlineads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeney\u2019s publication</a> lead to re-examination of the ranking algorithms, but similarly biased search results remain: Google searches for \u201cprofessional hairstyles\u201d are more likely to return images of women with European features, while results for \u201cunprofessional hairstyles\u201d return images of African American and Latina women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In facial recognition, the lack of gender, ethnic, and racial diversity in training and feature extraction leads to poor classification across diverse faces. In his <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e506/cdb250eba5e70c5147eb477fbd069714765b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2012 dissertation</a> <em>Heterogeneous Face Recognition</em>, Brandon Klare examined the accuracy of six facial recognition systems across gender, race, and ethnicity. Three were commercial systems, two were based on fixed computer vision algorithms, and one used machine learning. Each system performed significantly worse on female faces, even for the machine learning system retrained on female faces. Klare was able to improve the accuracy 1.5% on African American faces by training on an African American cohort. Klare attempted to improve performance on Hispanic faces but was not able to do so because of the limited size of the training set. The results show the impact of sampling bias, especially for the commercial systems, as well as feature selection bias: facial features used even in the machine learning system were skewed more toward male faces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although these results were from 2012, there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/01/google-sorry-racist-auto-tag-photo-app\">recent examples</a> that point to persistent bias in machine vision. The computer vision startup Kairos claims that <a href=\"https://www.kairos.com/blog/face-recognition-kairos-vs-microsoft-vs-google-vs-amazon-vs-opencv\">popular machine vision web services still practice exclusivity</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decision support covers a vast array of applications &#8212; these services hit home when this involves informing (or making) the decision about who will get approved for credit, an account, or who remains incarcerated. The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) system scores an offender for their risk of recidivism. COMPAS is used to make parole decisions in many places and has been the subject of several <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing\">investigative reports</a>. At issue again is how the learned model incorporates racial bias in its scoring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of particular importance to WordPress is the use of natural language processing (NLP). We are working on using NLP to build <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/05/24/may-the-bot-be-with-you-how-algorithms-are-supporting-happiness-at-wordpress-com/\">tools for our Happiness Engineers</a> as well as other applications. Machine-learned models for NLP have been shown to include both <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520\">gender</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06121\">racial</a> bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Multiple Perspectives on Discriminatory AI</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some perspectives from which to view, and potentially mitigate the impact of these systems:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><b>As a technical debt.</b> <a href=\"https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43146.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">An influential paper by Google developers</a> outlines how machine learning brings its own unique technical debt. Many of the mitigation strategies suggested by Google &#8212; especially in surfacing sample and latent biases &#8212; can be applied.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>As a inclusive design problem.</b> Automattic has committed itself to developing design guidelines that promote inclusivity. Many of the guidelines &#8212; establishing diverse teams and choosing data with care &#8212; are useful.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>As a problem in algorithmic fairness.</b> There is a growing body of work on de-biasing algorithms based on standards of fairness &#8212; being able to trade off precision/recall and other metrics against the impact on a group of users. The field is just beginning to address important questions like being able to detect sources of inequality in data before an application is deployed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Some paths forward</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some paths forward based on integrating the perspectives into a complete lifecycle of AI system design.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lifecycle-1.png?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"797\" height=\"553\" data-attachment-id=\"2191\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/10/04/data-speaker-series-charles-earl-on-discriminatory-artificial-intelligence/lifecycle-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lifecycle-1.png?fit=797%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"797,553\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Lifecycle\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Considerations for integrating perspectives into a complete lifecycle of AI system design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lifecycle-1.png?fit=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lifecycle-1.png?fit=797%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lifecycle-1.png?resize=797%2C553&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2191\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lifecycle-1.png?w=797&amp;ssl=1 797w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lifecycle-1.png?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lifecycle-1.png?resize=768%2C533&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Considerations for integrating perspectives into a complete lifecycle of AI system design.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<div id=\"v-jckHrKeF-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='400' height='300' src='https://videopress.com/embed/jckHrKeF?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Recommended reading</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a few papers that I refer to in the talk:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06121\"><b><i>Quantifying and Reducing Stereotypes in Word Embeddings</i></b></a> by Tolga Bolukbasi, Kai-Wei Chang, James Zou, Venkatesh Saligrama, Adam Kalai.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02413\"><b><i>Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning</i></b></a> by Moritz Hardt, Eric Price, Nathan Srebro.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://x.design.blog/\"><b><i>A remote conference on design and exclusion.</i></b></a></li>\n</ul>\n",

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/09/05/easier-ab-tests-with-automattics-own-tool-hypotheses/",
    "content": "\n<p>At Automattic, <a href=\"http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/2015%20Online%20Controlled%20Experiments_EncyclopediaOfMLDM.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A/B tests</a>&nbsp;help designers, marketing specialists, and developers to test their assumptions, measure the impact of new features, and make data-informed decisions. Our data science team built a tool, called \u201cHypotheses\u201d to automate data collection for as well as planning and analysis of A/B tests. In this post, you will learn what A/B tests are and how our internal tool makes them easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every A/B test is an experiment, similar to ones used to prove that a new medicine benefits patients. When the feature or change is ready to ship we initiate an A/B test where users are randomly divided into two groups, usually called <b>test</b> and <b>control</b>. For the duration of the test, only the users in the test group see the new feature or change. We use the data to make an informed decision about whether the test version performs better and should be made available to all users, or whether it underperforms the original and we need to go back to the drawing board to test new hypotheses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine, for example, that we wanted to know whether a localized greeting on the homepage is a good idea. We could test for an increase in the number of accounts created. During the A/B test, we would show the localized greeting only to a randomly selected subset of homepage visitors: a visitor from Texas would be greeted with <i>Howdy!</i> if they were assigned to the test group, and with a simple <i>Hi!</i> if they were assigned to the control group. During the A/B test, we count the number of users who visit the homepage and the number of users who create an account in each of the two groups, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we infer whether the new feature improves our conversion rate from the data we collected? Can we draw this conclusion if six out 10 vs. five out 10 users converted with and without the new feature, respectively? And if 60 out 100 vs. 50 out 100 users converted? The answer lies in the statistical analysis of the collected data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why did we build a tool?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to our work on this, our colleagues did not have a single place to perform these analyses. Instead, they had to combine several tools. Because we automated some of the tasks all A/B tests have in common, our colleagues can now worry less about math and statistical libraries and focus more on their experimental setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that, ideally, my colleagues should spend the vast majority of the time they dedicate to A/B testing thinking about questions such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><b>What do I want to learn from this test, i.e., what is my hypothesis?</b> Good hypotheses are precise and measurable. Examples of good hypotheses are: <i>Algorithm A drives more engagement than algorithm B.</i> or <i>Changing this step in our sign-up flow increases sign-ups</i>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>What is the target variable that I have to track to verify this hypothesis?</b> For the comparison between two content recommenders, it might be the number of clicks on recommended content. For changes to a sign-up flow, it might be the number of accounts created.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>How do I know how many users have been exposed to the test?</b>&nbsp; This might be the number of users who load a specific page (for example, the one where content recommendations are served) or click a button (for example, a sign-up button).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>Which aspects of the user experience will be different with the test?</b> If the test changes only the last of thirty recommendations or adds an item to the footer of a very long web page, the test might take a very long time before any significant differences can be seen.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Which users should be in the test?</strong> Some A/B tests might be country-specific or target users in a specific vertical. Users who do not belong to this group can dilute the results and increase the amount of data that has to be collected for a conclusive test.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Is now a good time to perform this test?</strong> Split testing is a good safeguard against external influences on your test results, such as seasonal variations. Nevertheless, there are cases in which external factors can influence whether the test results are indicative of future performance or not. If, for example, a marketing campaign is temporarily driving acquisition of one type of user a lot but your feature is designed for a different type, that might make a difference.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Am I sure that I have all the data I need to analyze this test?</strong> It is a good practice to ensure all the correct tracking is in place before the test starts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Our tool: Hypotheses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypotheses enables our colleagues to spend more time on these questions. They can use a web interface to provide data about the A/B test and define a funnel, i.e., a sequence of tracked user events that identify users who are eligible for the test and users who performed the target action. Based on this information, Hypotheses displays the latest conversion rate in the funnel and optionally shows the latest trends in the conversion rate. In this way, our colleagues can at the same time set up the analysis and confirm that data collection is working. Due to this tight integration with our tracking system, Hypotheses is an internal tool that is not available to anyone outside of Automattic. The following screenshot shows how a new A/B test is entered in Hypotheses.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-full wp-image-1999\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1580\" height=\"1436\" data-attachment-id=\"1999\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/screen-shot-2017-09-01-at-14-48-50-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-01-at-14-48-50-1.png?fit=1580%2C1436&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1580,1436\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"The Hypotheses Builder\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;In Hypotheses, information about the A/B test is collected through a graphical user interface.

Sometimes, a new feature has unforeseen side effects (a.k.a. bugs) that prevent users from converting or, in fact, having a good user experience. With Hypotheses, we can detect these cases and alert the creator of the A/B test.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bayesian and frequentist A/B tests</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sending daily updates is only possible because our tool is a <b>Bayesian</b> tool. In statistics, the two major schools of thought &#8212; frequentist (see, for example, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/91337\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Neyman</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/logicofchance029416mbp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Venn</a>), and Bayesian (see, for example <a href=\"http://www.stat.ucla.edu/history/essay.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bayes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1940-46-09/S0002-9904-1940-07280-5/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeffreys</a>) &#8212; &nbsp;interpret probability in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequentists interpret probabilities as the frequencies that would be observed if an experiment ran infinitely or was repeated an infinite amount of times. Frequentist methods give guarantees about what would happen in this very long run. For Bayesians, probabilities are subjective degrees of belief that are updated in the light of new data: our A/B tests start with the prior assumption that both variations are equally likely to outperform the other. As we collect data, we update this belief based on the new information we have collected. This <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/science/the-odds-continually-updated.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>New York Times</em> article</a> is an accessible introduction to Bayesian statistics with a comparison to the frequentist approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like two different philosophies, neither is plain right or wrong, and I believe that, <i>if</i> done correctly, both can be applied to A/B tests. In fact, I used a frequentist analysis in my PhD thesis on searches for astrophysical neutrino sources. In our fast-paced company, we have highly autonomous decision makers. They are as concerned about giving every user the best possible experience as about doing statistics correctly. As a result of this, I find Bayesian A/B tests better suited, as they\u2019re more intuitive and do not require a fixed sample size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We use the <b><a href=\"http://www.uvm.edu/pdodds/files/papers/others/everything/jeffreys1935a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bayes factor</a></b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&nbsp;to decide whether we trust an observed increase in conversion rate.

While its definition is fairly straightforward, calculating the Bayes factor is not. Going through its calculation is beyond the scope of this post but interested readers may read about it <a href=\"http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=sml/Bayes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more support for the hypothesis in the data, the bigger the Bayes factor. A small Bayes factor, in turn, shows that the data provides evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, i.e., a small Bayes factor implies that the change does not increase conversion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the Bayes\u2019 factor as a decision criterion is a choice. There are various other ways in which Bayesian A/B tests can be implemented. One other way is described on my colleague Yanir\u2019s <a href=\"https://yanirseroussi.com/2016/06/19/making-bayesian-ab-testing-more-accessible\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog</a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the many plans we have for the future of Hypotheses includes adding richer analytics. At the same time, we are collaborating with one of our designers to make the user interface shine. We are also exploring opportunities for automatic dashboard creation and easier sharing of the A/B test results.</p>\n",

Its <a href=\"https://github.com/clab/dynet\" rel=\"nofollow\">code</a> &#8212; has been getting a lot of notice lately in the computer language understanding community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use a simple analogy, you might think of a neural network as an information assembly line: some piece of information &#8212; a picture say &#8212; comes in, is processed, and the result of that processing is passed along to another stage until a final information product &#8212; a label for the picture &#8212; is produced. In most current architectures, the assembly line has to remain fixed. Learning amounts to adjusting the proportion a given stage takes as input from its predecessors. Using this analogy, DyNet allows the network to adjust the structure of those assembly line stages during training. Some impressive results have been reported for language processing.

Some product teams are responsible for user-facing data products such as search and recommendations.&nbsp;</span>Other teams work on internal data science products such as A/B testing tools. Depending on what they build, data product teams consist of data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, and sometimes designers or project managers. Product teams work with product managers, like Thorsten, who define what they build and why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">What is Product Management?</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At Automattic, we don\u2019t have dedicated product managers for data science. Instead, we take turns leading data science projects and product management is thus an activity that each of us gets to do to some extent.

They drive&nbsp;product development from the discovery phase, through definition and design, to delivery. They help the team to understand the why behind what they\u2019re building.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Thorsten contrasted his role to the one of a project manager: project managers help teams to be productive. At Zalando, they are experts in agile methodologies, and use daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and demo sessions. Product managers, on the other hand, set each team\u2019s roadmap and vision. They prioritize, act as a bridge to internal stakeholders, and represent the customer\u2019s view.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Discovery for data products</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Thorsten encourages data science teams to think of themselves almost as small startups within the company.

Among other points, he mentioned that:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The bottleneck for building a great data product is often getting enough labelled data, and not finding the best algorithm.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">When working with internal stakeholders like the marketing department, explainability is often as or even more important than the accuracy of the algorithm.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It\u2019s important to not only take responsibility for shipping a product but also for testing it. It\u2019s very likely that the data scientists in your team know more about A/B testing than internal stakeholders.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Recommended reading</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Thorsten recommended several books:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><b><i><a href=\"http://theleanstartup.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Lean Startup</a> </i></b>by<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&nbsp;Eric Ries</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><b><i><a href=\"https://strategyzer.com/books/value-proposition-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Value Proposition Design</a></i></b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&nbsp;by Alexander Osterwalder, Yves Pigneur, Gregory Bernarda, Trish Papadakos, Alan Smith</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><b><i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28951428-radical-focus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Radical Focus</a> </i></b>by<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&nbsp;Christina Wodtke</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><b><i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15807350-shipping-greatness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shipping Greatness</a></i></b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&nbsp;by Chris Vander Mey</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Many thanks to Thorsten for sharing his product management knowledge with us here at Automattic.

Our creed states it and the distributed environment in which we work necessitates it. But for people accustomed to writing out their thoughts as a basic function of how they work, how does meeting in person affect the <strong>density</strong> of our communication? Before I share the results of my analysis, let&#8217;s go over how we prefer to communicate at Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">P2s: Our Permanent Searchable Record</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our main communication platform is, of course, run on WordPress.com. We employ <strong>a network of blogs</strong> called P2s, that run the <a href=\"https://p2theme.com/\">P2 theme</a>. P2s allow us to post right from the blog&#8217;s homepage to have real-time, threaded discussions under the posts. We can cross-post to other teams&#8217; P2s, mention other Automatticians by name to notify them of a discussion, like posts, and follow discussions. <strong>Everything is archived and searchable.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We use Slack for real-time or casual discussions, but once a Slack conversation reaches a certain threshold or conclusion, we <strong>&#8220;P2 it!&#8221;</strong> and write a post on the relevant P2, because in Automattic&#8217;s world, if an important conversation is not documented on a P2 for the record, it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have three types of P2s:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Team P2s:</strong> Each team at Automattic has a main P2 &#8220;home.&#8221; This is where we post project threads, update our colleagues on project progress, share general, relevant knowledge, and field requests for help from other teams.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Project P2s:</strong> Some projects end up needing more resources, time, and cross-team efforts than others. For these projects, we create a project P2 so that everything relevant to the project is housed in one place.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Watercooler P2s:</strong> We have 78 Watercooler P2s dedicated to office chitchat. Most are organized around specific interests, topics, or locations. For example, we have the <em>Nomadomattic</em> P2 for discussions around leading a (digital) nomadic life, and a <em>Seattlematticians</em> P2 for those in Seattle.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Grand Meetup Effect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>However, our communication doesn&#8217;t just rely on text and then more text. We also <strong> meet up a couple times a year</strong> to enjoy each other&#8217;s company. Meeting in person lends a voice and personality to put behind the words we read when we return home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest of these meetups is called <strong>The Grand Meetup</strong> (or the GM), where the entire company comes together for a week somewhere around the world to discuss, teach, learn, hike, run, mountain bike, and party (the last few are optional, of course :).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-full wp-image-1852\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" data-attachment-id=\"1852\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/08/08/how-communication-density-fuels-automattic/gm-2016-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-2016-1.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Donncha \\u00d3 Caoimh&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Automattic Inc.&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Automattic at the 2016 GM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Automattic at the 2016 GM&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-2016-1.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-2016-1.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-2016-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Automattic at the 2016 GM\" class=\"wp-image-1852\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-2016-1.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-2016-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Automattic at the 2016 Grand Meetup in Whistler, Canada</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My colleague on the Data Science team, Boris, previously <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/04/12/welcoming-new-colleagues-a-data-based-story/\">wrote</a> about the GM for data.blog and showed (with data, of course) how important the GM is in developing and maintaining social ties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a series of analyses I did for the HR team about how Automatticians communicate with one another, I found out that<strong> the GM is also really good for our communication</strong>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked at three-month periods before and after the GM and found that <strong>our interactions in team and project P2s increase drastically and significantly</strong> in the after period. This is especially true for project and team P2s. With <strong>watercooler P2s, the percentage change was very little and it wasn\u2019t statistically significant</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All team and project P2s are classified as Work P2s and activity on a person&#8217;s own team&#8217;s P2 is classified separately as Own Team P2s. We are more active on cross-team project P2s and other teams&#8217; P2s after the GM.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"776\" height=\"455\" data-attachment-id=\"1819\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/08/08/how-communication-density-fuels-automattic/gm-effect-pctgs-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-effect-pctgs-1.png?fit=776%2C455&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"776,455\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"gm-effect-pctgs\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-effect-pctgs-1.png?fit=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-effect-pctgs-1.png?fit=776%2C455&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-effect-pctgs-1.png?resize=776%2C455&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"gm-effect-pctgs\" class=\"wp-image-1819\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-effect-pctgs-1.png?w=776&amp;ssl=1 776w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-effect-pctgs-1.png?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gm-effect-pctgs-1.png?resize=768%2C450&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also looked at the interaction network:<strong> who is talking to whom?</strong> In the network, each node represents an Automattician and there is an edge between one Automattician and another when one likes or comments on the other&#8217;s posts, or mentions them. The more frequent this interaction is, the higher weight the edge between them gets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To describe the results, I am going to introduce a new network concept: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science#Density\">Density</a>. A network\u2019s density is the ratio of all existing connections in the network and all possible connections. It is a way to measure <strong>cohesiveness</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since here, we are working with a weighted network, I modified the traditional density concept a little bit to be able to take strength of connections within the network into account. <strong>When a network\u2019s density is high, it means that all nodes are strongly connected.</strong> We have a very dense network at Automattic, especially around project and team P2s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what happens to our cohesiveness as a company after a GM? <strong>It increases a lot (by 11%) when it comes to team and project P2 interactions, and actually, decreases by 14% when it comes to watercooler interactions.</strong> We fill up with all the socialization we need for the next three months during the GM and get motivated to work on projects!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"776\" height=\"549\" data-attachment-id=\"1829\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/08/08/how-communication-density-fuels-automattic/dens-change-nets-bef-aft-gm-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dens-change-nets-bef-aft-gm-1.png?fit=776%2C549&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"776,549\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"dens-change-nets-bef-aft-gm\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dens-change-nets-bef-aft-gm-1.png?fit=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dens-change-nets-bef-aft-gm-1.png?fit=776%2C549&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dens-change-nets-bef-aft-gm-1.png?resize=776%2C549&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"dens-change-nets-bef-aft-gm\" class=\"wp-image-1829\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dens-change-nets-bef-aft-gm-1.png?w=776&amp;ssl=1 776w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dens-change-nets-bef-aft-gm-1.png?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dens-change-nets-bef-aft-gm-1.png?resize=768%2C543&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HR Analytics at Automattic</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies all over the world deal with<strong> issues related to communication and the seemingly overwhelming amount of information</strong> that is produced and consumed by separate teams. <strong>Teams can end up isolated</strong>, or unaware of discussions that are directly or indirectly relevant to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At Automattic, as a remote company, our advantage is that almost all of our communication is documented and archived.</strong> This gives us a great way to study our communication flow, identify problems, and build tools to solve them.

    "content": "\n<p>This week, Sirin, Boris, and Demet have some recommended reading for you in the fields of descriptive data analysis, machine learning, and ethics in artificial intelligence. Have you recently read anything thought-provoking in the field of data science? Written anything thought-provoking? Be sure to comment and share your recommendations with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sirin Odrowski</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/sirin.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/sirin.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"sirin\" class=\"wp-image-719\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"http://sethsd.com/\">Seth Stephens-Davidowitz</a> studies publicly available, anonymous Google Search data. His work reveals prejudices and sheds light on aspects of demography that are hard to tackle with surveys. It\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/09/everybody-lies-how-google-reveals-darkest-secrets-seth-stephens-davidowitz\">long, yet captivating read</a> and a great example data story telling that shows how insightful descriptive data analysis can be. It\u2019s also deeply infuriating because, among other things, his work implies that open racism and biases against girls are widespread.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Boris Gorelik</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"boris\" class=\"wp-image-716\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> The post \u201c<a href=\"https://explosion.ai/blog/supervised-learning-data-collection\">Supervised learning is great \u2014 it\u2019s data collection that\u2019s broken</a>\u201d talks about the pain common to many machine learning practitioners, namely, obtaining good quality labeled data. Citing the post:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Instead of waiting for the unsupervised messiah to arrive, we need to fix the way we\u2019re collecting and reusing human knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Demet Dagdelen</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/demet.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/demet.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"demet\" class=\"wp-image-718\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> This is a <a href=\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/\">Turing Institute</a> opinion piece on <a href=\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/media/opinion/towards-accountable-ai-europe/\">Ethical AI and accountability</a> which is always an effort to be celebrated. It discusses the shortcomings of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the potential to make it more enforceable in the future. I think as data scientists we should all be aware of the hidden biases in our work and aim to be as accountable as possible, but at the same time, it makes me question whether mandating fine-grained accountability from the algorithms we write might make our playing ground more restrictive. Though, even if that is the case, the trade-off may be well worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>In 2016 the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe\u2019s new data protection framework, was approved. The new regulation will come into force across Europe \u2013 and the UK \u2013 in 2018. It has been widely and repeatedly claimed that a \u2018right to explanation\u2019 of all decisions made by automated or artificially intelligent algorithmic systemswill be legally mandated by the new regulation. This \u201cright to explanation\u201d is viewed as an ideal mechanism to enhance the accountability and transparency of automated algorithmic decision-making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a right would enable people to ask how a specific decision (e.g. being declined insurance or being denied a promotion) was reached.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Because a single WordPress process could trigger many indexing jobs, all the indexing jobs go into an in-memory queue. There, we dedupe the jobs and optimize them. (For example, if 10 posts get changed we put them into a single job rather than 10 separate jobs.) Then, we add these jobs to a MySQL queue for indexing jobs on the WP shutdown action (runs at the end of every WordPress process).</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Longer running jobs are submitted to a separate queue so we can dedupe them across multiple web servers. This way, if a user\u2019s action requires us to reindex all of their posts, and then they immediately take another action that also triggers reindexing all the posts, we will only run a single job.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For high volume/busy blogs we sometimes convert jobs to just bulk reindex everything. For example when a user changes the name of a single tag we submit a job to only reindex the posts that have that tag. But if a user (or a script) changes 10 tags in less than 10 minutes, then we convert those jobs into a single bulk index job.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Run the Indexing Job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The main jobs system (built on a MySQL queue) runs jobs (mostly) in order, with a slight preference for higher priority jobs. We prioritize changes to single posts above bulk changes to many posts. The jobs system also imposes a slight delay on the jobs (milliseconds) to give the the database and memcache time to sync between data centers.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Each indexing job runs as its own WordPress process for the site to ensure we have the correct data. This means loading the correct theme and loading custom post types code. Because of the many customizations possible in WordPress code, it\u2019s not sufficient to look only at the database to get the data correctly prepared for indexing.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"447\" data-attachment-id=\"1598\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/07/11/real-time-elasticsearch-indexing-on-wordpress-com/runjob-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/runjob-1.jpeg?fit=600%2C447&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,447\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"RunJob\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/runjob-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/runjob-1.jpeg?fit=600%2C447&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/runjob-1.jpeg?resize=600%2C447&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"RunJob\" class=\"wp-image-1598\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/runjob-1.jpeg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/runjob-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Start Indexing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The start of the indexing job is our first opportunity to check for errors. We don\u2019t want to check for errors when submitting jobs because users are waiting on those requests.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">All indexing jobs run a number of checks when they start:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Check if the job is disabled. This applies backpressure on the jobs system if a cluster is overloaded. We also use this as a mechanism to disable indexing in emergencies. When jobs get disabled, the <code>blog_id</code> is recorded in our Failed Blog Queue so they can be reindexed later.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Verify that the indexing job looks right, otherwise <code>die()</code>, which will show up in error logs and alerts (e.g., an incorrect <code>blog_id</code>).</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For bulk indexing/deleting a blog, we apply a lock on the <code>blog_id</code>. When we can\u2019t get a lock, the job is retried (see below).</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It is also possible for jobs to have fatal errors due to custom <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/\">VIP</a> code or transient errors. These get picked up from our error logging and then go into the Failed Blog Queue.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Assuming those checks pass, we start indexing posts based on job type. Some jobs index/delete/update a single post; others index/delete many posts on a blog.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Refresh Elasticsearch Index</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a document has been sent to Elasticsearch, it still takes time before it\u2019s available in search results. Our indices\u2019 refresh rates are set to one second for all of our blog indices (one exception is the ES index powering the WP.com Reader which has a 30 second refresh).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Handle Indexing Runtime Errors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A number of errors can occur while a job runs:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">If an indexing error gets returned by Elasticsearch during indexing, the job enters the Retry Jobs Queue. Our most common errors occur when bulk indexing a set of 100 or more posts; if the posts are very large or need extra analysis, the indexing request can timeout. Sometimes the Elasticsearch server can also get briefly overloaded with a burst of indexing and reject some requests. Rejected requests are very rare for us &#8212; unless a server has a hardware problem.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">When database errors occur when trying to get the latest data, we also put the job into the Retry Jobs Queue. In these cases we&#8217;re hoping a temporary database performance issue will resolve itself by the next time we run the job. This typically occurs 500-600 times a day (0.0026% of all jobs).</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Due to the &#8220;fun&#8221; of PHP memory management, long running jobs (sometimes many hours) can run out of memory and we need to start a new job where we left off. For the most part we detect when the PHP process is about to run out of memory and resubmit the job, but very rarely the process will crash before we catch it and so it ends up in the Failed Jobs Queue.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Of course, when things go wrong the error rate can jump, and the same code that handles \u201cnormal\u201d errors also handles cases where many servers or an entire Elasticsearch cluster is non-responsive (hardware failures or network failures).</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">If an Elasticsearch error does occur, the indexing job sees the error, and based on the error code, may mark the Elasticsearch server down (stored in memcache) so that other jobs won\u2019t try to query/index that server for a few minutes. This further attempts to prevent indexing errors due to transient network connectivity or server issues. These events are pretty bursty; some days no servers are marked as down, other days, it happens 10-20 times in a day.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"557\" height=\"355\" data-attachment-id=\"1597\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/07/11/real-time-elasticsearch-indexing-on-wordpress-com/handleerrors-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/handleerrors-1.jpeg?fit=557%2C355&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"557,355\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"HandleErrors\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/handleerrors-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/handleerrors-1.jpeg?fit=557%2C355&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/handleerrors-1.jpeg?resize=557%2C355&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"HandleErrors\" class=\"wp-image-1597\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/handleerrors-1.jpeg?w=557&amp;ssl=1 557w, https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/handleerrors-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Retrying a Job</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A retry occurs when we expect a job&#8217;s error may resolve itself soon; for example a http error, a database error, or a timeout.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In these cases, we use the indexing job retry code:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The first time a job fails, resubmit it as a deferred job we\u2019ll run two minutes later.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Each subsequent time a job fails, we double the time until we\u2019ve run it four times over a period of 14 minutes (2 + 4 + 8 = 14 minutes). At that time, we add the job to the Failed Jobs Queue (below).</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We do a few hundred retries an hour with spikes if there\u2019s some indexing/cluster event going on. We add a very small number of jobs to the indexing retry queue. This really only happens during significant cluster events. Of 23 million jobs a day, we typically retry about 20k jobs a day (0.087% of all jobs).</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Failed Jobs Queue</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This queue handles the cases where a job fails completely, or something is so wrong with the clusters that we need to stop indexing. Job failures are spiky, and typically driven by fatal errors due to bad deploys. On normal days, we see 10 to 100 failed jobs.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We have an hourly cron job that looks at failed jobs each hour and sticks them into the Failed Jobs Queue. This queue currently consists of a table of blog_ids and the indices that those blogs should be reindexed into. Six times a day, a cron job empties up to 1000 sites from the queue. Effectively blogs that experience fatal errors or some other repeating failure to index should get back in sync with the database within 4 hours.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So how long does it take for a change to reach Elasticsearch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We don&#8217;t have full end-to-end instrumentation, and in the rare cases where an error occurs, the time can increase, but let\u2019s look at the typical times for a couple of examples.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> New post on <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack Search powered site</a> -> WordPress.com Database -> <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/\">VIP</a>\u00a0or Global Elasticsearch Index: a <strong>couple of seconds</strong>.</span>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sync data from the original site to WP.com: typically seconds unless there is a large backlog.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WP.com database writes to running the indexing job: less than a second.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add the doc to Elasticsearch: probably tens of milliseconds.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Refresh time on the Elasticsearch index: one second.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bulk sync a <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack-powered site</a> -> WordPress.com Database -> Global Elasticsearch Index: <strong>minutes to hours</strong>.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sync all data from the original site to WP.com: minutes to hours depending on the size of the site.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WP.com database writes completes running the bulk indexing job: five minutes because we dedupe bulk indexing jobs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Walk all posts in the WP.com database and send them to Elasticsearch: minutes to hours depending on the size of the site. A million post site can take four to eight hours.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Refresh time on the global Elasticsearch index: one second.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Change the name of a tag on WP.com -> WordPress.com Database -> Reindexing all posts that have that tag in a <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/\">VIP</a> Elasticsearch Index: <strong>five minutes\u00a0up to an hour</strong>.</span>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>WP.com database writes to run the indexing job: five minutes because we dedupe bulk jobs like this.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Updating the docs in Elasticsearch that have that tag: depends on the number of docs, but never more than an hour. If there are only a few hundred posts it should complete within a minute or so.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Refresh time on the Elasticsearch index: one second.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For many cases the slowest part of an &#8220;update&#8221; is actually waiting for the Elasticsearch query caching to timeout. We cut our query volume in half (and greatly reduce query latency) by caching all Elasticsearch queries in memcache. The cache timeout depends on the particular application. For most search applications it is between 30 seconds and five minutes. Jetpack Search has a two minute cache timeout. For services such as related posts, we have a 48 hour cache timeout.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Constant Improvements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Our indexing system has been iterated on for almost six years and continues to get better. We&#8217;re constantly learning how to run a better service. One multi-datacenter caching problem we solved in 2013 led me to this great quote from </span><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final170_update.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">a Facebook paper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> about replication across data centers:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We treat the probability of reading transient stale data as a parameter to be tuned, similar to responsiveness.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Elasticsearch mirrors our database, so just like a cache, our ES data will always be slightly stale relative to new changes to the database. By focusing on tuning the probability of not having stale data we reduce the likelihood of stale data affecting the user experience.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The indexing system we have today is significantly improved from what it looked like one year ago. We expect those improvements to constantly continue, year after year, as we find gaps we have missed, or reduce the gaps we are already aware of.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>At Automattic, we know you don&#8217;t have to come to an office every day to create <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">excellent products</a>. (Ours serve <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/activity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 400,000,000 unique visitors</a> a month.) Most of the time, we work from wherever&nbsp;we are, collaborating via the internet. From time to time, however, we meet in person for several days of intense discussions, socializing, and some sight seeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, Automattic&#8217;s Data Division got together for its annual meetup. This year, the datums, as we call ourselves, were in Montr\u00e9al. As Automatticians, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/\">our creed</a> includes the tenet &#8220;I will never stop learning.&#8221; This meetup presented an excellent opportunity for our in-house experts to share their knowledge and experience with the rest of the division &#8212; something we do often here at Automattic. The Data Division &#8212; made up of data scientists, data engineers, front-end developers, and designers &#8212; has a wide range of expertise to share with one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search Wrangler Greg Brown kicked things off with a discussion on the data structures that Elasticsearch implements for scaling search and analytics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up next, Code Wrangler Ben Lowery demonstrated how to build a redux-connected component with <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso\">Calypso</a>, the framework that powers WordPress.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After walking through the calculus of <a href=\"http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/OptimizationStochasticGradientDescent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stochastic gradient descent</a> and <a href=\"https://ayearofai.com/rohan-lenny-1-neural-networks-the-backpropagation-algorithm-explained-abf4609d4f9d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">back propagation</a>, I introduced folks to the Python deep learning library <a href=\"https://keras.io/\">Keras</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We delved into the&nbsp;intricacies of spam detection on WordPress.com. Code Wrangler Peter Westwood shared some of the latest trends in blog spam and the constant work it takes to keep squashing spammers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data Scientist Sirin Odrowski gave an overview of text analysis techniques, and discussed the theory and implementation of <a href=\"http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">word embeddings</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We learned more about the architecture of Spark from Data Engineer Anand Nalya, and he gave us a great overview of the internal tools available for debugging our Spark applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Data Engineer Xiao Yu gave us some tips for optimizing query speed using Impala and Hive, sharing details of how queries are processed by both engines and when it\u2019s beneficial to use one over the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all that, we took a day off to see some sights, throw some axes, and do some whitewater rafting!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t all code, calculus and coffee! Our division lead, Martin Remy, also inspired a series of strategic discussions, centered around better serving our users. The Data Division has a unique role in developing products for WordPress.com users, like the Reader, and developing internal tools aimed at connecting Automatticians with the data relevant to their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/data_meetup_martin.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/data_meetup_martin.png\" alt=\"Martin Remy at the whiteboard\" class=\"wp-image-1478\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Nothing motivates hard work like a stern boss</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic is a growing company with a huge impact on the open web. The Data Division is just one part of the complex machinery that keeps Automattic running smoothly. We love our work, we love the challenges it poses, and the impact we create. We&#8217;re also very friendly and love working with smart people from different countries and cultures. You should definitely check out our <a href=\"http://automattic.com/jobs\">Work With Us</a> page to see whether one of our open positions is right for you.

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/06/12/timeseries-analysis/",
    "content": "\n<p>Being highly professional, many data scientists strive toward the best results possible from a practical perspective. However, let\u2019s face it, in many cases, nobody cares about the neat and elegant models you\u2019ve built. In these cases, fast deployment is pivotal for the adoption of your work &#8212; especially if you&#8217;re the only one who&#8217;s aware of the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is exactly the situation in which I recently found myself. I had the opportunity to touch an unutilized source of complex data, but I knew that I only had a limited time to demonstrate the utility of this data source. While working, I realized it&#8217;s not enough that people KNOW about the solution, I had to make sure that people would NEED it. That is why I sacrificed modeling accuracy to create the simplest solution possible. I also had to create a RESTful API server, a visualization layer, and a Slack notification system. As a result, the proposed solution, despite being oversimplified, is being gradually adopted across Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post describes anomaly detection in time series. However, it is not about time series modeling, but rather about product development. This story, told in chronological order, is based on actual events, but I bend the historical truth in favor of the better story. I hope you\u2019ll enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In deep trouble (?)</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>You might know that Automattic is a distributed company, meaning that everyone works from wherever they prefer. Currently, the data science team is spread across four continents. From time to time, we meet in person. One such meeting took place in Berlin, Germany. During that meeting, Carly, the lead of the data science team, told us that Automattic CFO, Stuart West, asked us to apply some data science magic to the company\u2019s financial information. It turns out that despite the fact that all the financial data is available through an internal dashboard site, almost no real-time analytics were performed on that data.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright alignnone wp-image-1459\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/figure_024.png?w=1506\" alt=\"Post-it notes on a window glass\" class=\"wp-image-1459\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ideas in Berlin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most obvious way to find value in such a data source is to deploy an anomaly detection system. Such a system would monitor our company\u2019s money and alert us in cases where something unusual happens. If you have ever analyzed time series, you might know that this is a complex problem. However, to the surprise of my teammates, I proclaimed that in our case, this problem was already solved. \u201cIn this case,\u201d Carly said, \u201cyou\u2019ll be responsible for this project!\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might wonder what I was thinking when I declared this problem solved. After all, time series come in various shapes and types: seasonal fluctuations, trends, a combination of multiple seasons and a trend, binary series, complex series such as an electrocardiogram, you name it. Plus, every type of time series can have various anomaly types: sudden changes in several values &#8212; in the period size or the amplitude &#8212; to name a few. Besides, real-life data sources can be influenced by malicious users, are prone to concept drift, and over- or under-saturation of the measurements. All these factors make time series analysis a very complex task. Why, then, was I so sure that the solution would be simple?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/figure_006_normal_.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/figure_006_normal_.png?w=640\" alt=\"timeseries types and forms\" class=\"wp-image-1422\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Time series types and forms.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The simplicity ladder</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is that in Automattic&#8217;s case, most of the complicating factors are either irrelevant or negligible. Recall that this project deals with the financial data of Automattic. Thus, it is very unlikely to be affected by malicious users. Automattic is a big enough company that sells services that are not affected by immediate external events. This means that the financial data is relatively stable. Stable data dynamics means simple modeling and even easier anomaly detection. The only challenges that I could not ignore were multiple seasonalities and concept drift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple seasonality is a situation where a data series fluctuates as a function of two different cycles. For example, when speaking about sales of WordPress.com Premium Plans, one would expect some fluctuation during the business day, another fluctuation period during the week, and yet another dependent on the time of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/figure_003_trend_two_periods_.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/figure_003_trend_two_periods_.png?w=640\" alt=\"multiple seasonality example\" class=\"wp-image-1423\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">An example of multiple seasonality, combined with a trend.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple seasonality is indeed a serious challenge. However, we can mitigate it by trimming the resolution and the history size. By only analyzing the data at the daily resolution, we will ignore the differences during the day; and by limiting the history of the model to several weeks, we will only see daily fluctuations over the work week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concept drift is a phenomenon of gradual changes in the statistical properties of a variable. Naturally, such a drift poses new challenges to the modeler. However, the same measures that we take to deal with multiple seasonality are also able to minimize the concept drift problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/figure_009_gradual_change_.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/figure_009_gradual_change_.png?w=640\" alt=\"concept drift example\" class=\"wp-image-1424\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">An example of concept drift.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me recap the current situation. By making reasonable assumptions about the data, and limiting the scope of our analysis, we ended up analyzing a relatively easy problem: a set of non-interacting time-dependent variables with a linear trend, and a single seasonal period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are numerous methods that we can use for this issue. One such method is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average\">autoregressive integrated moving average</a> (ARIMA). Using this approach, we use statistical analysis to separate a time series into a seasonal and non-seasonal component. Many textbooks teach ARIMA as the first method to analyze time series. I hoped to be able to use it for my problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The hole is deeper than I thought</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I was too optimistic. According to my plan, I would fit a model to the actual data, compute the differences between the observed and predicted values, analyze the distribution of these differences (also called \u201cresiduals\u201d), and treat the points with the highest deviation from the model as anomalies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/figure_019_process_data_and_model_anomaly_marked_.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/figure_019_process_data_and_model_anomaly_marked_.png?w=640\" alt=\"process: data and model. anomaly marked\" class=\"wp-image-1425\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Process: data and model. (Anomaly marked.)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Recall that I decided to use ARIMA to model the data. During the modeling process, we combine the ARIMA equation and the observed data to obtain the equation parameters. Frequently, obtaining the correct parameters requires heavy custom-tailored data preprocessing. Otherwise, the process will result in a nonsense model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was prepared to perform this preprocessing for a dozen dashboard metrics. What I forgot was the fact that each dashboard metric can be sliced and diced into a myriad of components \u2014 according to various business units and geographical areas. In this situation, we have hundreds, if not thousands of potential metrics, which means that manual fitting is out of the question.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Light at the end of the tunnel</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, I had three choices. I could have limited myself to the primary metrics, hoping for the best. I didn\u2019t like this option. I could automate the parameter fitting process using a series of smart heuristics. This option seemed like the \u201cright one,\u201d but it would require a long development process. The third option was to search for a \u201cone tool fits all\u201d solution. I was very fortunate to find a <a href=\"https://github.com/welch/seasonal\">python package</a> called <code>seasonal</code>, which was exactly the solution I was looking for. This package decomposes time series into the trend and seasonal components in a very robust manner. The combination of this robustness with the assumptions made earlier meant that I could obtain a reasonable model for any metric I wanted to. Surely, this universal nature comes at the cost of accuracy, but it was \u201cgood enough\u201d for all my practical needs. I was happy again. All I had to do was to summarize the results in a nice Jupyter notebook and find a catchy name. That\u2019s how a2f2 (anomaly analysis &amp; future forecast) was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jupyter_simulation.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jupyter_simulation.png?w=640\" alt=\"screenshot. Jupyter simulation\" class=\"wp-image-1427\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A screenshot of a Jupyter simulation.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, thanks to the many assumptions, the modeling part of the project took one week. This includes data collection, experimentation, coding, and parameter selection. Interestingly, it took three more months to bring a2f2 to the point where its output is valued and required by the relevant \u201ccustomers\u201d in the company. During these three months, we\u2019ve built a framework that includes a REST API, interactive visualization, and periodic jobs that push anomaly alters to subscribers. This is a topic for an additional story, which I told during the last <a href=\"http://il.pycon.org/wwwpyconIL/agenda/188%20\">PyCon Israel conference</a>. Here is the slide deck from my <a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/a2f2.pdf\">a2f2 presentation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-cloudup wp-block-embed-cloudup wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"a2f2.key\" class=\"cloudup_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://cloudup.com/ioBi4C3cg3w?chromeless=true&amp;autoplay=false\" data-uid=\"ioBi4C3cg3w\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.36986301369863\" width=\"500\" height=\"365\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When good enough is NOT good enough</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the resulting solution the best we can do? Certainly not! Currently, its biggest problem is too many false positives due to an inability to ignore deviations that are \u201ctoo small to care\u201d from a business point of view. Also, a2f2 can\u2019t forecast metrics with complex or somewhat erratic dynamics. However, it is indeed <strong>good enough</strong>. It is good enough to provide valuable and relevant information to the company&#8217;s business people. It is good enough to justify more development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make no mistakes. By itself, a2f2 wasn\u2019t good enough to justify additional developmental resources. It was the framework around the model (visualization, web server, periodic alerts) that triggered the interest in a2f2. A stand-alone model is only good enough for the modeler \u2014 the person with intimate knowledge of the numbers and the model. If there\u2019s one thing that I\u2019ve learned from this project is that other people just want to have their jobs done and don\u2019t care about your modeling efforts. That is why delivering a solution is much more important that refining the method. Essentially, I\u2019ve rediscovered the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product\">Minimal Viable Product approach</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Libraries mentioned in the talk</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://bokeh.pydata.org/\">Bokeh</a></strong> an excellent data visualization library.

Machine learning models, particularly those used in deep learning, may have hundreds or thousands of dimensions. t-SNE can be used to transform hundreds of dimensions down to two or three. With two dimensions, it is possible to draw graphs that make it easier to see the relationships a model has learned. The article sheds light on what t-SNE does well, and where its results are more open to question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post is published in the <a href=\"http://distill.pub\"><em>Distill Research Journal</em></a> &#8212; a new online machine learning journal focused on articles that prioritize visualization and interactivity. <em>Distill</em> is definitely worth checking out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Xiao Yu</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/xiaoyu.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/xiaoyu.jpeg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1396\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> I found this post about <a href=\"http://mysqlserverteam.com/mysql-8-0-retiring-support-for-the-query-cache/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MySQL removing the query cache</a> quite interesting.

It was more important to build out our data systems so that we can, for example, make sure blog visitor counts are updated around a certain set interval predictability for every user, rather then having a system that can quickly update counts but with such a large variability that users can&#8217;t easily predict how up-to-date the numbers are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People can work around a constant speed bottleneck of some kind and schedule around it but having a large variation forces people to wait on the application which is a worse overall user experience, even if the average time spent waiting is less.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chris Rosser</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chrisrosser.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chrisrosser.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1398\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daftpunk/aroundtheworld.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Around the world, around the world<br>\nAround the world, around the world&#8230;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are pop lyrics <a href=\"https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/\">getting more repetitive?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pudding.cool/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Pudding</em></a> looked for repeated sequences in pop lyrics from the &#8217;60s to the present day using the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression algorithm.

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/05/24/may-the-bot-be-with-you-how-algorithms-are-supporting-happiness-at-wordpress-com/",
    "content": "\n<p>Our excellent support is a big part of what makes WordPress.com a compelling platform for so many. Each month, we respond to 60,000 support requests on topics ranging from plugins to&nbsp;mapping existing domains to WordPress.com. Some questions arise several times daily, while others require novel solutions from our Happiness Engineers who have&nbsp;a deep understanding of our products, a skill for asking the right questions, a commitment to support, inventiveness, and creativity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, in looking at how <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\">machine learning</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing\">natural language processing</a> could be useful to Happiness Engineers (HEs) in responding to support questions, we discovered two places where these technologies offer value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, our Happiness Engineers often rely on tried and true responses to some of the more straightforward questions. We call these pre-defined responses <i>predefs</i>. Many HEs develop personal favorites, and some predefs eventually become part of our best practices based on their ability to succinctly express the answers that users are looking for. In our investigation, our first question was:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Could we develop a more powerful predef mechanism &#8212; a predef dictionary capable of generalization that would supply the HE with suggested responses based on best practices?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The figure below illustrates the idea in action.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/01-data-blog-bot-response.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/01-data-blog-bot-response.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1265\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Happiness Engineer would glance at the suggestion, and if acceptable, could send it to the user or modify it as they see fit. For more complex questions, the suggestion bot (I&#8217;ll just call it a bot for short) remains silent while the HE interacts with the user. The bot should be able to recognize when questions are outside its expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/02-data-blog-no-response.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/02-data-blog-no-response.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1268\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The second important case arises at the end of a chat. HEs tag chats to identify the main issues addressed during the conversation. Our PayPal chat begins with an e-commerce-related question, but could jump to other topics, such as selecting a blog theme, for example. Tagging chat sessions helps us understand how issues are trending, and this information informs both staffing and product improvement. Oftentimes, the need to quickly move from one support session to another means that the chat goes untagged, and valuable information goes unrecorded: automatically tagging each chat not only solves this problem, it inspires the second question:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><i>Could we develop ways to automatically tag a given support conversation?</i></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the suggestion bot and auto-tagging&nbsp;rely on a mechanism to classify the chat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;d like to discuss some of the approaches we explored for chat classification &#8212; how we collected data, the approaches we used for classification, what worked and what didn&#8217;t, and the insights we gained from the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is chat classification?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these applications are really about labeling chats. For response suggestions, the label is associated with a response, and since there may be several types of questions related to enabling a blog for e-commerce, we need finer discernment for response classification.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/03-data-blog-bot-classifier.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/03-data-blog-bot-classifier.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1272\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Using machine learning for classification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One approach to take in building the classifier here is to use machine learning &#8212; instead of specifying explicitly the rules for matching a question to a response, we use an algorithm that can discover the rules on its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our initial hope was to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning\">unsupervised machine learning</a> for this task. Our chat metadata can include tags, but the tags themselves do not distinguish between chat topics at the response level. For example, we get many questions related to domains, and there are at least a dozen types of issues within this high level topic, and each requires a distinct approach to troubleshooting. However, the high level tag, <i>domains,</i> puts all of these issues into one group. Could an unsupervised learning algorithm discern these distinct subtopics on its own? We tried clustering based on chat features extracted using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA, <a href=\"#f1\">[1]</a>) and word2vec <a href=\"#f2\">[2]</a>, but neither approach resulted in categories with enough granularity for questions and answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We began developing a classifier using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning\">supervised machine learning</a>, but this required building a richer taxonomy of chat labels &#8212; labels that would map directly to concrete responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where do the labels come from?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key ingredient for supervised machine learning work is lots of labeled data for the algorithm to learn from. But we needed detailed labels at the specificity that would allow the labels to be linked to the appropriate answers. The first task was to develop this taxonomy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our taxonomy uses the question types encountered in day-to-day operations. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping\">treemap diagram</a> below depicts the main question types from that taxonomy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/04-data-blog-classification.png\" alt=\"04-data-blog-classification\" class=\"wp-image-1275\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions related to site appearance and domain management figure prominently in the taxonomy. Present also is the <em>e-commerce</em> category in which we placed the PayPal question. There&#8217;s also a <i>needs-human</i> sub-category that represents questions on which the bot knows not to chime in. We realized that most of the chats fall into this category &#8212; a lot of the questions we address simply don\u2019t have quick answers and require the human touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having defined the taxonomy, we developed a web application that would allow HEs to assign labels to chats based on the taxonomy. That is, to link questions to the most appropriate answers, we needed to have the questions split into more precise categories than used for tagging. In collecting these labeled questions, we were also concerned about inter-rater reliability: we wanted the classifier to give answers that would agree with responses most HEs would give. We structured the labeling process so that each question and answer pair was labeled by at least two Happiness Engineers, and it was our original plan to train only on those cases for which we had consensus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building the classifier</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final taxonomy has 109 sub-categories, each paired with its own response. We used a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model\">vector space bag of words document model</a> for the first iteration of our trainer. That is, we formed a vector representing each token using feature hashing <a href=\"#f3\">[3]</a> and used the count of the token in a given document to indicate its weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The algorithm we used initially was the One Against All (sometimes referred to as one-against-the-rest <a href=\"#f4\">[4]</a>) multi-class (OAA) classifier. Assuming that the number of categories is <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"N\" class=\"latex\" />, the OAA algorithm trains <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"N\" class=\"latex\" />&nbsp;logistic regression classifiers, one for each class. Each of these sub-classifiers learns to distinguish its target class &#8212; <em>e-commerce:paypal</em>, say &#8212; from all of the others. This can be contrasted with a one-vs-all multi-class classifier, which requires training <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"N^2\" class=\"latex\" /> classifiers. We used the popular Vowpal Wabbit machine learning library <a href=\"#f5\">[5]</a> to construct the classifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Preliminary results</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We labeled a total of 2,702 chat questions, and of these there were 1,063 unique questions (providing for double annotation). To get a baseline measure of performance, we trained the OAA classifier chats with double annotation, for which annotations were in agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the 1,063 labeled questions 20% were set aside for validation&nbsp;and another 10% were set aside for testing. Even after several weeks of chat labeling, we faced the large challenge of an imbalanced data set. That is, a little over half of the labeled questions were in categories that aren&#8217;t helpful in assisting HEs &#8212; <em>needs-human</em> (the questions requiring deeper investigation) or <em>parting-message</em>&nbsp;&#8212; as shown below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/figure_028_imbalance20in20distribution20of20chat20categories20in20training20set_.png\" alt=\"figure_028_Imbalance in Distribution of Chat Categories in Training Set_.png\" title=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at individual counts of examples for appearance and domains sub-categories highlights the imbalance issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/figure_007_low20counts20of20appearance20and20domains20subcategories20in20training20set_.png\" alt=\"figure_007_Low Counts of Appearance and Domains Subcategories in Training Set_.png\" title=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the categories in this original analysis had too few representatives to train on and there were cases where a single instance of the category appeared in the training set and not in evaluation or test sets and vice versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only 13 out of the 109 chat classes had representative samples in both training and test sets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We therefore had to look into a number of ways to collect additional examples, without overly imposing on the HEs who had done the initial labeling. (Some of our findings could be useful for organizations trying to develop machine learning applications on limited data.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Expanding the training set</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The central problem facing us was data imbalance: a lot of examples of one kind (<em>needs-human</em>) of question but very few of the other kinds (<em>domains:add-mapping</em>). Broadly speaking, the approaches to this problem are to either make better use of the few examples that are available, or collect new ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We first attempted to label new data, but the task of identifying several thousand examples of sparse classes was challenging. The next choice was to identify a way to weight the examples so that the learning algorithm can pay more attention to the infrequently occurring cases, and less to those cases which occur frequently. This works for some classes better than others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also attempted to generate synthetic examples to address the imbalance. Again, this had impact on some cases more than others. We speculate it is because the cases we were attempting to model tend to be far apart in syntactic similarity. The most impact came from bootstrapping with nearest neighbor search and from the use of cross validation. These are described below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bootstrapping using semantic search</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A third approach we tried was to identify new examples based on the unsupervised machine learning methods. In this approach, we turned to word embeddings to help identify candidate questions and responses to include in an expanded training set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this search, we used word embeddings constructed using Facebook&#8217;s fastText library <a href=\"#f6\">[6]</a>. FastText learns embeddings that predict successor and precursor characters allowing it to encode frequently used abbreviations and misspellings. These are abundant in chat questions. Using fastText we trained a 300 dimensional word vector model on our corpus of chat logs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The search algorithms look through chat logs for those question and answer pairs for which the question is highly similar to a labeled question (i.e., the cosine similarity between the sentence vectors <a href=\"#f7\">[7]</a> is &gt;= 0.9) and the answer contains the help URL&nbsp;associated with the labeled answer. These highly likely examples are then added to the training set. We were able to add 7,000 more examples to our training set and achieve a better balance of training examples using this approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cross validation to make the most out of our set</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another approach useful for boosting the impact of smaller data sets is cross validation. Typically in the development of machine learning models, there are three distinct sets: train, validation, and test. It has been shown that you can effectively split the entire set into <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"N\" class=\"latex\" /> folds, and train a model on&nbsp;<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"N-1\" class=\"latex\" /> folds using the <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"N\" class=\"latex\" />th fold as a holdout. You can then do this <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"N\" class=\"latex\" /> times on distinct hold out folds, and then use the decisions arrived at by the <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" alt=\"N\" class=\"latex\" /> different models to arrive at a collective decision <a href=\"#f8\">[8]</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The cumulative effect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining these methods resulted in a dramatic improvement in the performance of our classifier as measured by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score\">F1 score</a>.&nbsp;The comparison below shows the performance of the initial baseline against chats collected some months after the expanded training set. In this comparison the scores associated with the high level categories <i>domains, appearance, </i>and <i>account </i>are averaged across the scores for the respective subcategories.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/figure_008_improved20performance20with20enhanced20training20set_.png\" alt=\"figure_008_Improved Performance with Enhanced Training Set_.png\" title=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scores are consistent with results reported for state of the art question answering systems <a href=\"#f9\">[9]</a> and we are looking into ways to improve performance across the <i>domains </i>category. There is significant improvement over the baseline model.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main takeaway from our work on classifiers is that you can in fact derive a lot of value from using machine learning on smaller data sets. The other is that intermediate models &#8212; in our case the word embeddings constructed with fastText &#8212; can be used effectively to bootstrap larger sets for training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re now in the process of putting the classifiers described here into production to support our Happiness Engineers. We are exploring whether neural network architectures &#8212; in particular recurrent neural networks <a href=\"#f10\">[10]</a> &#8212; can provide better performance than the OAA model.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a name=\"f1\"></a>1.

Check out our recommendations and share your perspectives on them in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Boris Gorelik</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"boris\" class=\"wp-image-716\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> Are you a stereotypical millennial who\u2019s curious about many things and loves your information fast, fun, and to the point? Are you also interested in learning about machine learning, neural networks, and other cool stuff? You aren\u2019t, but you know such a person? Make sure to check the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A\">Siraj Raval\u2019s YouTube channel</a>. Siraj is a Pythonista, a machine learning geek, a rapper, and, apparently, a YouTube star. He\u2019s talking about self-driving cars, stock exchange prediction, image classification, and other cool stuff in terms that do not require deep prior knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/the-dark-side-of-data-science\">The dark side of data science</a>\u201d discusses the problems around relying too heavily on learning algorithms. The problems described in this post lie on the interface between technology and ethics. One example of such a problem is \u201ca person denied a loan by a faulty risk model is more likely to be denied again when he or she applies elsewhere, simply because it is on their record that they have been refused credit before.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of ethical problems, you should also read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/02/facebook-executive-advertising-data-comment\">this post</a> by Antonio Garcia-Martinez, an ex-Facebook data scientist whose main claim, that \u201cthe social media giant could target ads at depressed teens and countless other demographics. But so what?\u201d is both bold and controversial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Steve Kaeser</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/stevekaeser.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1242\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> I\u2019ve been a big fan of <a href=\"http://www.goodmath.org/blog/\">Good Math/Bad Math</a> for a number of years. He\u2019s recently posted about <a href=\"http://www.goodmath.org/blog/2017/04/27/introduction-to-neural-networks/\">neural networks</a>, which is something that I\u2019ve been looking to learn more about. Like his previous posts, he\u2019s done a good job of explaining a topic so that is easy to read and understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Carly Stambaugh</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"carly\" class=\"wp-image-717\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> If you talk to me for than five minutes about neural networks, I\u2019ll likely mention training one to write poetry. I\u2019m kind of obsessed. Well, the folks over at OpenAI have discovered something that would be an awesome addition to my artificially intelligent poet: sentiment. They\u2019ve developed a model that creates a product review &#8212; character by character &#8212; with a twist. You can specify whether you want the generated review to be positive or negative by overwriting a single neuron. <a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/unsupervised-sentiment-neuron/\">This post</a> details how they discovered this \u201csentiment neuron\u201d and gives some examples of generated reviews. There\u2019s even a neat graphic that shows how the value of the neuron changes as it encounters new characters during training.</p>\n",

(Such a setup isn\u2019t flawless, of course, but is a common practice in many perception studies.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, graphical representation was effective, at least for some tasks, according to this study: &#8220;When initial attitude is not strongly polarized, charts seem to have a stronger effect than tables on persuasion likelihood and attitude change.\u201d Surprisingly, there were tasks in which \u201cthe table[s]&#8230;have a higher percentage of&#8230;change than the charts.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the paper implies that tables, unlike charts, are <strong>not</strong> a form of data visualization. It seems that tables are \u201cfoster children\u201d of data visualization, as they don&#8217;t often get the appreciation they deserve. From my experience, tables can serve as a powerful visualization tool. When I teach data visualization, I devote at least one lesson to tables. I\u2019m glad this study provides empirical confirmation of the importance of tables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are your experiences using data visualization in the field?

    "content": "\n<p>With over 545 employees spread over more than 50 countries, Automattic is one of the largest distributed companies in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://automattic.com/about/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/welcomming_newmatticians_3.png?w=640\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1186\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being distributed means that we, as Automatticians, work on our common goal to democratize publishing from wherever we wish. It also means that we heavily rely on online communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides providing flexibility, working in a distributed company brings challenges when you meet in person. <em>Does X from team I/O appreciate informal humor?</em> <em>What is the hobby of Y, a member of the Happiness Engineering team?</em> <em>Does Z, our team\u2019s HR person, smile a lot or only when taking a gravatar picture?</em> The answers to these questions are trivial to get in a \u201ctraditional\u201d company but not in a distributed environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this information is critical. It helps us relate to one another and form strong relationships that nourish creativity and cooperation. If the challenge doesn\u2019t seem hard enough to you, recall Automattic has more than 545 employees and is constantly growing. We passed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number\">Dunbar\u2019s number</a>&nbsp;a long time ago. Dunbar\u2019s number is 150 &#8212; it&#8217;s a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. Keeping strong social ties in such an environment can be complicated for the existing employees, but is even harder for newcomers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does Automattic foster social bonding and avoid isolating its distributed employees? How do we ensure that our new colleagues feel welcome and integrated with the company, its culture, and values?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being distributed doesn\u2019t mean we never meet face to face. Every team meets at least once during the year. (We call these gatherings Meetups.) Once a year, the entire company meets for a grand gathering (called, unsurprisingly, the Grand Meetup). It&#8217;s full of exciting activities, town halls, and social events. These meetups &#8212; especially the Grand Meetup &#8212;<br>\nplay a critical role in creating new social ties and maintaining old ones. How do we know that? Since you\u2019re reading <a href=\"http://data.blog/\">data.blog</a>, the answer is obviously, \u201cwe have the data for that.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A warning before you read further: while reading this post, you might get the idea that maintaining social connectivity in a growing, distributed company is as simple as bringing the people together. This is far from true. Be sure to read the final section \u201cSo what is the secret sauce?\u201d to learn about the hard work behind what seems to be a social success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic has an internal self-service tool that allows Automatticians to track colleagues they&#8217;ve met in person. We call this tool Meetamattician. Using this tool, we can visualize the network of \u201cwho met whom\u201d within Automattic. This is how our network looked after the 2013 Grand Meetup in San Francisco:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/welcomming_newmatticians_6.png\" alt=\"welcomming_newmatticians_6\" class=\"wp-image-1189\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the figure above, every circle represents an Automattician; if two people met face-to-face, their circles are connected with a line. I suppose that you noticed two different colors. These colors represent a grouping such that there are more ties within the group than between them. Formation of such groups (termed as \u201cclusters\u201d) is a natural process in any social network. In this case, the division mostly represents the division between the developers and the non-developers. Note that we can detect this division using the right network algorithm &#8212; it&#8217;s not very strong, and there are many ties between the two \u201csubpopulations.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year passed. Many new excellent people joined the company and another Grand Meetup took place in 2014. Did we, as a company, manage to keep tight social integration? It looks that we did:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/welcomming_newmatticians_7.png\" alt=\"welcomming_newmatticians_7\" class=\"wp-image-1190\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may see some blue dots in the figure above. The appearance of the additional color means that our algorithm detected another, third, cluster of Automatticians. Nevertheless, the company\u2019s social structure after the 2014 meetup is still very tight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One additional thing about the dot colors is worth remembering. In any given graph, Automatticians that belong to the same group are represented by the same color. However, the group colors are not preserved between the pictures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between the 2014 and 2015 Grand Meetups, Automattic <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2015/05/woomattic/\">acquired</a> WooCommerce and 50 new people joined the network. At the time of acquisition, Woo was a company of super talented and awesome people. It is not surprising, then, that before the 2015 Grand Meetup, the social graph of Automatticians contained a distinct cluster&nbsp;of Woo Ninjas (the green circles in the figure below):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/welcomming_newmatticians_4.png\" alt=\"welcomming_newmatticians_4\" class=\"wp-image-1187\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the acquisition took place less than half year before the 2015 Grand Meetup, we already had dozens of new personal ties. But look at the social network immediately after the 2015 meetup:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/welcomming_newmatticians_2.png\" alt=\"welcomming_newmatticians_2\" class=\"wp-image-1185\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I call this a successful integration. Would you agree with me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don\u2019t stop. Another year passes, and another group of Newmatticians joins the company. Before they had the chance to meet the entire company in person at the 2016 Grand Meetup, the social landscape of Automattic looked like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/welcomming_newmatticians_0.png\" alt=\"welcomming_newmatticians_0\" class=\"wp-image-1183\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you spot all those Newmatticians? These are the sparsely connected dots that surround the larger interconnected crowds. This is exactly how I felt during my first meetup in 2014. Before that meetup, I had met fewer than a dozen Automatticians in person, and I felt like an outsider, intimidated by the fact that \u201ceverybody knows everyone.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the 2016 Grand Meetup, you can barely see any \u201coutsiders.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/welcomming_newmatticians_1.png\" alt=\"welcomming_newmatticians_1\" class=\"wp-image-1184\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the network is much denser now, with fewer distinct groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>So, what is the secret sauce?</b></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Only about myself did I know how to speak.</span><br>\n<span style=\"color:#808080;\">My world is as narrow as that of an ant.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Rachel [Bluwstein], Hebrew-language poet, 1890\u20131931</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people (me included) tend to avoid unpleasant situations. Meeting strangers can and often is, an unpleasant situation especially when you&#8217;re surrounded by hundreds of new people many of whom are smarter than you are. Before my first Grand Meetup, I planned to sit in the corner, minding my own business, hoping not to be spotted by one of the Automattic geniuses. I know that other new Automatticians felt the same way. And yet, when you look at the post-Meetup social graphs, you don\u2019t see many lone wolves. What is the secret?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, when I arrived in Park City, Utah, where I attended my first Grand Meetup, I met awesome, very social, curious, and accepting people. I felt that the entire company, from Matt, our CEO, through Lori, our HR lead, to every employee, did their best to make newcomers feel welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is not the whole story. From time to time, every person needs to eat. Since it\u2019s impossible to feed more than 10-20 people at the same table, we split into groups. This is where the magic happened. During grand meetups, you don\u2019t decide with whom you have your lunches and dinners. Moreover, a special script ensures that you never eat with the same person twice. You may think that such an arrangement would be emotionally exhausting. You are absolutely right. However, in the long run, this exhaustion pays. It is due to this gentle push for socialization during meal times, that I met a lot of interesting people, had productive conversations, and expanded my knowledge about different professions, cultures, and religions. But most of all, despite working in a distributed environment, and despite meeting some of my colleagues only once a year, I feel a part of a vibrant, fun, and creative group of people, working together to democratize publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/welcomming_newmatticians_5.png\" alt=\"welcomming_newmatticians_5\" class=\"wp-image-1188\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

There are so many things I love about this article. Not only is it a strong article from a data science perspective &#8212; it explains and introduces technical concepts well &#8212; I also like to read it as a digital anthropological analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spend way too much time on Reddit. In the past few years, whenever I venture away from the safe haven of smaller subreddits I&#8217;ve curated to my front page, I realize how hate-filled Reddit can be. But online communities, especially on Reddit, are fascinating to me. Author Trevor Martin has a very good understanding of Reddit (which many journalists don&#8217;t). The results of his analysis come as no surprise to anyone who spends enough time on the website. In my experience in data science, the lack of &#8220;no-surprise-to-anyone&#8221; means that the methodology works. A minor improvement could have been made by taking the score of the comments into account, since not everyone who comments on a subreddit actually supports the ideas of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still mulling over this article days later and can&#8217;t wait to dig into the code and the data as well &#8212; I feel like I can already tell this will be one of my favourite pieces from 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an interactive tool based on this methodology and data that received &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Reddit hug of death</a>&#8221; when the article was first published, but you can play around with it <a href=\"http://www.shorttails.io/interactive-map-of-reddit-and-subreddit-similarity-calculator/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Did you discover any interesting connections? Let us know!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charles Earl</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/charles.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/charles.png?w=150\" alt=\"charles\" class=\"wp-image-865\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of papers by <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~xanda/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alexandra Schofield</a> and <a href=\"https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Mimno</a> recently caught my eye. Mimno maintains the popular NLP library <a href=\"https://github.com/mimno/Mallet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mallet</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In natural language processing pipelines, a text is usually pre-processed in some way before we begin to look for deep statistical or semantic regularities. Stop wording and stemming are are two common pre-processing operations. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stop wording</a> is where ubiquitous words that might contribute little to the meaning of a text are removed. For example, <em>the apple in the orchard</em> becomes <em>apple in orchard</em> if <em>the</em> is in the list of stop words. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stemming</a> is when a word is replaced by its base. For example, <em>eating apples</em> becomes <em>eat apple</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the papers, &#8220;<a href=\"https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/papers/schofield_eacl_2017.pdf\">Pulling Out the Stops: Rethinking Stopword Removal for Topic Models</a>&#8221; (PDF), and &#8220;<a href=\"https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/papers/schofield_tacl_2016.pdf\">Comparing Apples to Apple: The Effects of Stemmers on Topic Models</a>&#8221; (PDF), Schofield and Mimno look at natural language pipelines that produce <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">topic models</a> &#8212; a kind of text feature extraction that infers topics common to a collection of documents. They make convincing arguments that stop wording and stemming add little to topic model quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these results are specific to the kind of models Schofield and Mimno are building and the corpuses they analyze, the results certainly offer some flexibility to the practitioner in terms of constructing text pipelines. In many cases, reducing the size of an index or model is critical (filter stop words liberally!), while in others, being able to feed text &#8220;as-is&#8221; into an application can simplify the code and enable faster development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S. I loved the titles of these papers!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Carly Stambaugh</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"carly\" class=\"wp-image-717\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> I do believe there are situations where it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to treat your tools as a black box, but Andrej Karpathy makes a great argument in his post, &#8220;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b\">Yes you should understand backprop</a>,&#8221; that back propagation is not one of them. It includes practical examples, and as an added bonus, has links to free lectures on the subject.</p>\n",

    "title": "Improving Relevance and Elasticsearch Query Patterns",
    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/03/15/improving-relevance-and-elasticsearch-query-patterns/",
    "content": "\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress.org plugin directory</a> has been significantly rebuilt over the past year and should go live soon (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins-wp/\">test site</a>). Many from across the WordPress community helped with this effort. I focused on improving plugin search relevancy. This was a great learning experience on how to build more relevant searches for a couple of reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>There is a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/08/30/initial-analysis-of-plugin-search-logs/\">decent volume of search traffic</a> (100,000 searches per day and over 500k unique search queries\u00a0per month).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The repo is small enough to iterate easily (45k total plugins) and yet has enough users and use cases that it can be pretty complex. We went through five major iterations on how to index the data.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A lot of people care and have opinions about how plugin search can be better. This makes for a great opportunity to learn because it is easy to get lots of feedback.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite&nbsp;building search engines with <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch\">Elasticsearch</a> for many years, my opinion on how to structure an Elasticsearch query and index content changed a lot because of this project. This post describes my latest opinions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background on Plugin Search</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In surveys about WordPress, the&nbsp;community regularly rates the plugin ecosystem as both a top strength and a top weakness of WordPress. Plugins give users flexibility in building websites, but can also be a source of frustration due to updates, incompatibility, and getting support when something goes wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most popular plugins are installed on millions of websites and are often built and maintained by teams of developers. But many plugins are small; they fill many different niches, and have varying levels of developer support. Sometimes they solve a problem really well, sometimes they are abandoned and rarely used.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Algorithm Philosophy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, a search algorithm is driven by design opinions about the problem you&#8217;re solving. In looking at the data and having discussions over the years, I&#8217;ve developed some opinions about plugin search:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We design search primarily for end users, not for developers. Developers make up a small percentage of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/08/30/initial-analysis-of-plugin-search-logs/\">100k searches each day</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We steer end users toward plugins that are most likely to give them the best WordPress experience. This doesn&#8217;t mean simply matching text, but rather trying to answer the question implied by the text: <em>Which plugin will solve problem X for me?</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plugins shouldn&#8217;t just solve the problem right now; they should still solve the problem a year or two from now. Past history is the best indicator we have of a plugin&#8217;s future.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search terms indicate demand for a feature, and active plugin installs indicate the supply side of that equation. If 10k people per year want a particular feature, we should recommend plugins that can support that volume of new users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I expressed this on the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1692\">search relevancy ticket</a> and I know that some of it is controversial. Opinions usually are. Let me try an example. (Disclaimer: I&#8217;ve worked on Jetpack Stats in the past.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users search for &#8220;stats&#8221; 93 thousand times a year. (It&#8217;s the 13th most frequent search on the plugin directory.) Here are the top four search results with the old algorithm:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-01-20-at-1-07-45-am.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2017-01-20 at 1.07.45 AM.png\" class=\"wp-image-966\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The old search suggests that 90 thousand people per year go and install plugins that collectively, have only proven that they can &#8220;handle&#8221; 20 thousand users. Scaling stats as a service (as many plugins do) can be quite hard and expensive. Sending 90k new users per year to these plugins seems unrealistic. Even if the plugin doesn&#8217;t work as a hosted service, it still needs to scale answering support requests from end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s compare that to the top four suggestions from the new search algorithm:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-08-at-12-58-10-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2017-03-08 at 12.58.10 PM.png\" class=\"wp-image-963\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These install counts make a lot more sense given that we&#8217;re getting 93k searches per year. Collectively, these four are already used by millions of sites, so sending a hundred thousand more sites toward them each year will not overwhelm them. Presumably users we direct toward them will have a good experience with those plugins &#8212; as millions already have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In improving the fidelity of search results, it&#8217;s not just a question of how we satisfy a single&nbsp;user&#8217;s search query, but how we satisfy thousands of users for each unique search term: which plugins will support that volume of users and their requests for support? Which are&nbsp;most likely to give all of these users a great WordPress experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Evaluating Results</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To build relevant search, you need a plan on how to iterate on evaluating search results. In the previous iteration of plugin repo search, we didn&#8217;t have good click data for evaluating search, nor did we have a way to evaluate it on live traffic, so I used a few sets of searches for my testing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>&#8220;Important&#8221; searches. This was a list of about 50 searches. Important searches include some searches from the top 10 and some that I and others found interesting. A number of the searches that were cited as feedback on the search ticket ended up in here (&#8220;responsive slider,&#8221; &#8220;event,&#8221; &#8220;import,&#8221; &#8220;transport,&#8221; &#8220;glotpress&#8221;). We focused particularly on searches that were ambiguous or were words that would show up for completely unrelated plugins.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Top 1k searches. This covers 46% of all searches.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Random 1k from the top 100k: just take the top 100k and randomly select from among them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Random 1k from the bottom 400k searches. These are mostly searches that occurred\u00a0once over the course of two months.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I repeatedly ran the search queries I evaluated against these lists and imported them into a spreadsheet to sort and evaluate them. Because 3000+ searches is way too many to manually evaluate, I tried to focus on a few things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Were the &#8220;important&#8221; searches looking good for the top 14 results?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Which searches received zero to four results? How many of them were there? (This analysis also led to defining some future work on <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2416\">auto corrections</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Which searches had the lowest/highest ratio of <code>active_installs</code> to number of times the search was performed? (I tried to use this as a proxy for the supply vs. demand ratio I mentioned above. I also used a similar ratio for resolved support threads.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t a perfect system, but it allowed me to quickly iterate and evaluate new index mappings and queries. None of these &#8220;metrics&#8221; were good indicators of performance, but having them let me sort the queries, focus on the outliers, and work to improve the results overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Elasticsearch Query Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve started to think about the generic structure that I apply when writing Elasticsearch (ES) queries, and how that structure can help me create relevant results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past year, I&#8217;ve settled into some common patterns. The core of searches are almost always a text-matching portion boosted by a number of other signals. The structure also splits the query into three parts: (1) function boosting applied to meta data about the documents; (2) an <code>AND</code>&nbsp;text query that reduces the set of documents that match; and (3)&nbsp;a section that boosts the document scores&nbsp;based on the text of the documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So overall, there are three major sections of the query: function boosting, text matching, and text boosting. These all get wrapped together into a single ES query, but let&#8217;s discuss the sections separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Function Boosting</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A search query that is modified by a number of other signals is straightforward:</p>\n\n\n<p>[code]<br />\n&quot;query&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;function_score&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;query&quot;: {<br />\n//Text scoring query (text matching and text boosting)<br />\n},<br />\n&quot;functions&quot;: [<br />\n//series of functions to multiply the text score<br />\n],<br />\n&quot;boost_mode&quot;: &quot;multiply&quot;<br />\n//if any signals are open ended, set a max using max_boost<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For simplicity I&#8217;ve left off any filtering of the results&nbsp;to focus just on scoring the documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the plugin search, we use a number of different signals. Initially we adjusted them on an ad-hoc basis, by looking at a single query and making small tweaks. Eventually we discovered that making adjustments for one query would hurt a different query. I found that graphing the functions across the ranges that mattered to me helped a lot. The charts below are from my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/gibrown/5ded937f53bf00605b0b98ba13df1b1d\">(very simple) graphing code</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We iterated on the <code>active_installs</code> boosting three times, so it&#8217;s a good example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It started as <code>sqrt( active_installs )</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/sqrt.png\" alt=\"sqrt.png\" class=\"wp-image-1023\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This had the problem where <code>sqrt</code> increases very quickly when applied to a field that is exponential in nature. Starting from 1, <code>active_installs</code> goes up to 1,000,000. Clearly, 1 million installs is not a million times more important than a single install. But even with a square root we increase much too quickly and give the 1 million plugin 100 times more importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we switched to <code>ln( active_installs )</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/log2p.png\" alt=\"log2p.png\" class=\"wp-image-1026\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is better, but we found that there was not enough differentiation between a plugin installed 100k times and one that was installed more than a million times. We often ended up recommending a plugin with 50k installs even though there was one with 500k that seemed like a better option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This resulted in combining two functions for boosting active installs:</p>\n\n\n<p>[code]<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;field_value_factor&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;field&quot;: &quot;active_installs&quot;,<br />\n&quot;factor&quot;: 0.375,<br />\n&quot;modifier&quot;: &quot;log2p&quot;,<br />\n&quot;missing&quot;: 1<br />\n}<br />\n},<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;exp&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;active_installs&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;origin&quot;: 1000000,<br />\n&quot;offset&quot;: 0,<br />\n&quot;scale&quot;: 900000,<br />\n&quot;decay&quot;: 0.75<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exponential turns the logarithmic curve into a mostly straight line from 100k to 1m so that there&#8217;s more differentiation in that range. You can see the difference:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/combined.png\" alt=\"combined.png\" class=\"wp-image-1028\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the other signals were not this complicated and only needed minor adjustments. Along the way, writing out the actual scoring equation also helped a lot. In the end, our boosting looks something like this:</p>\n\n\n<p>[code]<br />\ntext_score *<br />\n0.375 * log2p( active_installs ) *<br />\nexp( active_installs, 1000000, 0, 900000, 0.75 ) *<br />\n0.25 * log2p( support_threads_resolved ) *<br />\n0.25 * sqrt( rating ) *<br />\nexp( tested, 4.7, 0.1, 0.4, 0.6 ) *<br />\ngauss( plugin_modified, 2017, 180d, 360d, 0.5 )<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though active installs is important, we also focus on signals that plugin authors have a lot more&nbsp;control over and are behaviors that should lead to a good user experience:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Resolving support threads.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keeping the plugin update to date.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Testing the plugin on the latest versions of WordPress.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Text Matching</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>During this project, I decided that the way I&#8217;ve been structuring my search queries did not give me enough flexibility when trying to reason about and fine tune the search. In the past, I have been using a text query that looks something like this:</p>\n\n\n<p>[code]<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;multi_match&quot; : {<br />\n&quot;fields&quot; : [<br />\n&quot;title.ngram^2&quot;,<br />\n&quot;content&quot;,<br />\n&quot;tags&quot;,<br />\n&quot;author^2&quot;,<br />\n],<br />\n&quot;query&quot; : &quot;post stats&quot;,<br />\n&quot;operator&quot; : &quot;and&quot;,<br />\n&quot;type&quot; : &quot;cross_fields&quot;<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s break down these pieces:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We search across a number of fields, and boost some individual fields. (For example, the author is twice as important as the content because if you match on author you are probably doing an author search.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Partial word boosting is very helpful for plugin titles so we use n-grams. My favorite example of this is &#8220;Formidible,&#8221; a form builder plugin with a name that is slightly too clever to score well in a search for &#8220;form.&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use an <code>AND</code> operator. The user specified both &#8220;post&#8221; and &#8220;stats.&#8221; The docs we return should have both terms in them. This is the behavior users expect.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We match across fields. This way if &#8220;stats&#8221; is in the title and &#8220;post&#8221; is in the content, the document will still match. Search will feel broken otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Often I would wrap the above in a boolean query with this as a <code>must</code> clause, and then add a <code>should</code> clause that would boost the results when we matched a phrase. So if &#8220;post stats&#8221; is in the doc, it would be boosted a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above query structure works OK, but I found it very difficult to separate which set of documents were getting matched from how we were scoring those documents. The <code>title.ngram</code> for instance can be a very noisy matching query, but when I tried adjusting it I kept finding other cases that would break. Like most search problems, when something isn&#8217;t working well, it&#8217;s time to rebuild and restructure your index. So I added a new field called <code>all_content</code> that contained all the text about the plugin: title, author, slug, content, tags, etc. Then I built a query that mostly separated matching documents from boosting the score based on the text of the docs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The text query pattern became:</p>\n\n\n<p>[code]<br />\n&quot;bool&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;must&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;multi_match&quot;: {<br />\n//must match against the content,<br />\n// but very low boost so the score is mostly inconsequential<br />\n&quot;fields&quot; : [ &quot;all_content_en^0.1&quot; ],<br />\n&quot;query&quot;: &quot;USER_QUERY&quot;,<br />\n&quot;operator&quot;: &quot;and&quot;<br />\n}<br />\n},<br />\n&quot;should&quot;: [<br />\n//a series of other queries that are used to boost the results<br />\n]<br />\n}<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, document matching is mostly separated from determining which document has the most relevant text. The docs which match our query are&nbsp;determined by the <code>all_content</code> field entirely. This also works great for search as you type. We can build an&nbsp;<code>all_content.edgengram</code> field to match against very efficiently. When all we have is a few characters, the ranking will be determined by this field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>all_content</code> field always contributes some scoring to our results, but because of the low boost, if any of the <code>should</code> clauses match, then those will completely dominate the scoring. If none of the boosts match though, then this basic query ensures we get some ranking which will mostly get reranked by our function boosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Implementation detail: In our case&nbsp;we treat the <code>all_content</code>&nbsp;field as an entirely independent ES field, but Elasticsearch also has a <code><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.2/copy-to.html\">copy_to parameter</a></code> in its mappings that can be used to implement it.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Text&nbsp;Boosting</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When any of the <code>should</code> clauses match, our score effectively becomes the sum of the different queries in the <code>should</code> clause. When debugging&nbsp;individual queries that are not performing well, we can focus on coming up with a new query clause to improve those specific results without worrying too much about the changes affecting the set of documents we&#8217;re scoring. It&#8217;s still important to test the impact, but in my experience it&#8217;s a lot easier to reason about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if I see a number of cases where it looks like we want to match a partial word in the title of a plugin, we can add this query to the <code>should</code> list:</p>\n\n\n<p>[code]<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;match_phrase&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;title_en.ngram&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;query&quot;: &quot;USER_QUERY&quot;,<br />\n&quot;boost&quot;: 0.2<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because these are n-grams (and it is a 3-5 n-gram field), the boost doesn&#8217;t need to be very high to have a strong impact. But because we&#8217;re not including n-grams in the <code>must</code> portion of the query, we won&#8217;t have as much noise as we did before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, we now have a much more complicated-looking query, but it was surprisingly easy to reason about how to build it when evaluating specific cases:</p>\n\n\n<p>[code]<br />\n&quot;bool&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;must&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;match&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;all_content_en&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;query&quot;: &quot;stats&quot;,<br />\n&quot;operator&quot;: &quot;and&quot;,<br />\n&quot;boost&quot;: 0.1<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n},<br />\n&quot;should&quot;: [<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;multi_match&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;query&quot;: &quot;stats&quot;,<br />\n&quot;fields&quot;: [<br />\n&quot;title_en&quot;,<br />\n&quot;excerpt_en&quot;,<br />\n&quot;description_en&quot;,<br />\n&quot;taxonomy.plugin_tags.name&quot;<br />\n],<br />\n&quot;type&quot;: &quot;phrase&quot;,<br />\n&quot;boost&quot;: 2<br />\n}<br />\n},<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;match_phrase&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;title_en.ngram&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;query&quot;: &quot;stats&quot;,<br />\n&quot;boost&quot;: 0.2<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n},<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;multi_match&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;query&quot;: &quot;stats&quot;,<br />\n&quot;fields&quot;: [<br />\n&quot;title_en&quot;,<br />\n&quot;slug_text&quot;<br />\n],<br />\n&quot;type&quot;: &quot;best_fields&quot;,<br />\n&quot;boost&quot;: 2<br />\n}<br />\n},<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;multi_match&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;query&quot;: &quot;stats&quot;,<br />\n&quot;fields&quot;: [<br />\n&quot;excerpt_en&quot;,<br />\n&quot;description_en&quot;,<br />\n&quot;taxonomy.plugin_tags.name&quot;<br />\n],<br />\n&quot;type&quot;: &quot;best_fields&quot;,<br />\n&quot;boost&quot;: 2<br />\n}<br />\n},<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;multi_match&quot;: {<br />\n&quot;query&quot;: &quot;stats&quot;,<br />\n&quot;fields&quot;: [<br />\n&quot;author&quot;,<br />\n&quot;contributors&quot;<br />\n],<br />\n&quot;type&quot;: &quot;best_fields&quot;,<br />\n&quot;boost&quot;: 2<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n]<br />\n}<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have also&nbsp;been using this same query structure on other projects and so far it&#8217;s&nbsp;made iterating on algorithm relevancy much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also take a look at how the whole query gets put together in <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/wordpress.org/public_html/wp-content/plugins/plugin-directory/libs/site-search/jetpack-search.php#L663\">the source code</a>. The actual query also has some interesting customizations for searching in non-English languages given that many plugins do not have good translations to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/\">hundred or so languages that WordPress supports</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to help build better search for the Open Web?

The interesting thing here is that functional programming languages (like Scala, Haskell, and OCaml) provide very solid abstractions for both composing programs and reasoning about their behavior. This could be a way to make the development and testing of complex machine learning programs a lot easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think: how far can we take this approach? Does it make it easier to develop new deep learning systems? There has been a lot of discussion this post. I\u2019m curious to know how other data science teams might be using it in practice. Share your thoughts and ideas in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sirin Odrowski</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/sirin.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/sirin.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"sirin\" class=\"wp-image-719\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling\">Hans Rosling</a>, a Swedish statistician, physician, and educator with a unique way of bringing data to life, passed away this month.

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2017/02/21/hows-your-new-years-resolution-going/",
    "content": "\n<p>Talking with friends last week, many of us sheepishly admitted that we have already &#8220;broken&#8221; our 2017 resolutions. According to a popularly cited study by <a href=\"http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1002/jclp.1151?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1\">Norcross in 2002</a>, only 64% of 150 participants who had made resolutions were able to stick with them beyond a month. A recent <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/1222-being-a-better-person-tops-list-of-2017-resolutions/\">Marist poll</a> lists some popular choices for New Year&#8217;s resolutions. Among them, being a better person, losing weight, and exercising more ranked high among the thousand or so respondents. I began to wonder: are WordPress.com users showing any observable trends surrounding New Year&#8217;s resolutions? When I have questions about content across all of WordPress.com, I turn to our Elasticsearch Index!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out whether people were writing about New Year&#8217;s resolutions, I searched for posts that feature both the words <em>new</em> and <em>resolution</em> in the title, content, tag name, or category name. I used a boolean query, with both a <code>must</code> and a <code>should</code> clause. Notice that I included a <code>\"minimum_number_should_match\": 1</code> in the query. This means that at least one of the conditions of the <code>should</code> clause must be met for the result to be considered a match.</p>\n\n\n<p>[code]<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;query&quot;:{<br />\n&quot;bool&quot;:{<br />\n&quot;must&quot;:[<br />\n{&quot;term&quot;: {&quot;site_id&quot;: 1}},<br />\n{&quot;range&quot;:{&quot;date_gmt&quot;:{&quot;from&quot;: &quot;2017-01-01&quot;,&quot;to&quot;: &quot;2017-02-07&quot;}}}<br />\n],<br />\n&quot;should&quot;:[<br />\n{&quot;bool&quot;:<br />\n{&quot;must&quot;:[<br />\n{&quot;term&quot;:{&quot;tag.name.en&quot;:&quot;new&quot;}},<br />\n{&quot;term&quot;:{&quot;tag.name.en&quot;:&quot;resolution&quot;}}</p>\n<p>]<br />\n}<br />\n},<br />\n{&quot;bool&quot;:<br />\n{&quot;must&quot;:[<br />\n{&quot;term&quot;:{&quot;category.name.en&quot;:&quot;new&quot;}},<br />\n{&quot;term&quot;:{&quot;category.name.en&quot;:&quot;resolution&quot;}}<br />\n]<br />\n}<br />\n},<br />\n{&quot;bool&quot;:<br />\n{&quot;must&quot;:[<br />\n{&quot;term&quot;:{&quot;content.en&quot;:&quot;new&quot;}},<br />\n{&quot;term&quot;:{&quot;content.en&quot;:&quot;resolution&quot;}}<br />\n]<br />\n}<br />\n},<br />\n{&quot;bool&quot;:<br />\n{&quot;must&quot;:[<br />\n{&quot;term&quot;:{&quot;title.en&quot;:&quot;new&quot;}},<br />\n{&quot;term&quot;:{&quot;title.en&quot;:&quot;resolution&quot;}}<br />\n]<br />\n}<br />\n}</p>\n<p>],<br />\n&quot;minimum_number_should_match&quot;: 1<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found some! As I suspected, the resulting data set is much larger than the previous studies I mentioned. Our wealth of public content provides a unique perspective on these questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To look at the distribution of those posts over time, we need to add an aggregation clause. This query gives us the number of posts that meet the criteria that are posted by day.</p>\n\n\n<p>[code]<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;query&quot;:{<br />\n&quot;bool&quot;:{&#8230;},<br />\n&quot;aggs&quot;: { &quot;d&quot;:<br />\n{ &quot;date_histogram&quot;:<br />\n{ &quot;field&quot;: &quot;date_gmt&quot;,<br />\n&quot;interval&quot;: &quot;day&quot; }<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datablogp2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/post-over-time.png\" alt=\"post-over-time\" class=\"wp-image-71\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\nFor reference, I&#8217;ve also made plot of posts about dogs by day. Notice that while the number of posts about dogs consistently dips on the weekends, the trend remains constant over time. However, resolution posts show a definite, quick drop off. Whether or not these writers are still sticking to their resolutions is unclear from this, but they certainly aren&#8217;t writing about them as much six weeks later! So far this year, 50% of all posts about New Year&#8217;s resolutions occurred within the first 10 days of January.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, resolution posts don&#8217;t immediately show the &#8220;weekend dip&#8221; that we see in dog posts. In general, posting tends to drop a bit on Saturdays and Sundays. By adding the following aggregation to our query, we find the Sunday and Monday are the most popular days for writing about resolutions.</p>\n\n\n<p>[code]<br />\n{<br />\n&quot;query&quot;:{<br />\n&quot;bool&quot;:{&#8230;},<br />\n&quot;aggs&quot;: { &quot;d&quot;:<br />\n{ &quot;terms&quot;:<br />\n{ &quot;field&quot;: &quot;date_token.day_of_week&quot; }<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this aggregation clause, I use the key <code>date_token</code>. Our Elasticsearch Index has a token for both the GMT time and the user&#8217;s local time. This allows us to look at calendar trends even though we have users all over the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, do our users share the same goals as those in the Marist poll? (Being a better person, losing weight, exercising more, and spending less money were the top four items from the Marist poll.) We have to do some content and tag analysis to find out. For this task, I&#8217;m going to switch from our Elasticsearch Index to using Python to analyze a sample our New Year&#8217;s resolution posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For ease of calculation, I took a small sample of ~2500 posts from those we identified with our Elasticsearch queries. To identify some common goals of our users, I used a Python library called <a href=\"http://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/\">TextBlob</a>, and extracted two and three word phrases, like &#8220;social media&#8221; or &#8220;read more books&#8221; from the post content. I calculated the frequency of these phrases, in order to pick out the most common ones. Once I had the top 200 phrases, I had some more filtering to do. Phrases like &#8220;Happy New Year&#8221; and &#8220;New Year&#8217;s Resolutions&#8221; of course were very common, but don&#8217;t give any information about our user&#8217;s resolutions. Other common but irrelevant phrases included &#8220;I think,&#8221; &#8220;I would like,&#8221; &#8220;really good,&#8221; etc. Identifying nouns and verbs seemed like a great next step to discerning the relevant phrases that actually communicated the writer&#8217;s intent. By knowing the parts of speech in the phrases, I could identify actions, and exclude phrases that contained a pronoun, for example. After this process, I had some great examples; &#8220;comfort zone,&#8221; &#8220;fresh start,&#8221; and &#8220;lose weight&#8221; were among them. Also among them were &#8220;something new,&#8221; &#8220;new me,&#8221; and &#8220;weight loss.&#8221; Because of the obvious similarities, I manually grouped them into broader categories and totalled them. The chart below shows the most popular categories in our sample.<br>\n<img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-885\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/popular_goals.png?resize=1878%2C1146\" alt=\"popular_goals.png\" width=\"1878\" height=\"1146\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight loss certainly is a popular goal! We also see being a better person and exercise in our sample. Interestingly, our users also have resolutions about social media, reading and, not surprisingly, blogging and writing. Even my own resolution to drink more water appears on the list!</p>\n",

(Note that Pachter&#8217;s critiques can be harsh as, for example <a href=\"https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/the-network-nonsense-of-manolis-kellis\">here</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/the-network-nonsense-of-albert-laszlo-barabasi/\">here</a>; be sure to read the comments for criticism on the critique itself.) If you write or read scientific literature as part of your work, follow this blog as a reminder not to blindly follow \u201cexpert authority.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A question to you, the reader: how often do you find yourself disagreeing with a renowned scientist only to dismiss yourself, thinking \u201cthey know better\u201d? Do you even bother reviewing a paper <strong>critically</strong> if you read it in a \u201cglamor\u201d journal written by a celebrity author? I&#8217;m curious about your thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charles Earl</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/charles.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/charles.png?w=150\" alt=\"charles\" class=\"wp-image-865\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> At our recent meetup at the <a href=\"https://href.li/?http://www.netscix2017.com/\">NETSCI-X</a> conference, <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~yoavg/uni/\">Yoav Goldberg</a> recommended &#8220;<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06121v1.pdf\">Quantifying and Reducing Stereotypes in Word Embeddings</a>&#8221; (PDF) by Tolga Bolukbasi, Kai-Wei Chang, James Zou, Venkatesh Saligrama, and <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/adum/\">Adam Kalai</a> as a good study of how the gender and racial bias inherent in training data can creep into machine learning models. Word embeddings have emerged in the last two years as a very powerful and readily applied tool for natural language processing. I think the work is quite relevant for us in particular as we incorporate this technology into search and recommendation products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My questions for you: how are you addressing the bias that might be implicit in the data and models used to power your applications? Can you effectively detect or remove the bias? How do you communicate this to your users?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Greg Ichneumon Brown</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/gregav.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/gregav.jpeg?w=150\" alt=\"gregav\" class=\"wp-image-875\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend &#8220;<a href=\"https://robertovitillo.com/2017/01/23/an-overview-of-mozillas-data-pipeline/\">An overview of Mozilla\u2019s Data Pipeline</a>&#8221; over at <a href=\"https://robertovitillo.com/about/\">Roberto Agostino Vitillo</a>\u2019s blog.

    "content": "\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Welcome to the third part of our mini-series \u201cIntro to Search.\u201d In my previous posts, I\u2019ve discussed the <a href=\"http://data.blog/2016/08/24/intro-to-search-initial-considerations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">characteristics of great search results</a> and what a <a href=\"http://data.blog/2016/09/27/intro-to-search-anatomy-of-a-search-engine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search engine looks like from the inside</a>. But, how do we know if our algorithms actually deliver relevant search results? The answer is, of course, by measurement!</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There is no single method for measuring search performance. Several factors determine our approach:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Intentions (the reasons the search engine was built in the first place),</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">the available type of data, and</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">the amount of data.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Intention</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Search engines make archives, inventories, websites, large publishing platforms, and the internet navigable. Different sites take different approaches to optimize their search, based on their needs. For example, &nbsp;a medical database would optimize their search algorithm for relevance. An online shop would optimize for sales. A platform with sponsored content would optimize search to direct traffic to their paying customers.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress.com Reader&#8217;s search engine helps our users find posts most relevant to their interests. We know they often go for broad, inspirational search terms, perhaps seeking inspiration or a community in which to grow their own writing or photography.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-68\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/data_blog_cloud.png\" alt=\"data_blog_cloud\" class=\"wp-image-68\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The most common English search terms in the WordPress.com Reader in the first few weeks after the launch of our search engine. The font size indicates the number of users who searched for the term. Incomplete words as search terms are the result of search-as-you-type.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/screen-shot-2017-01-06-at-14-00-171.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/screen-shot-2017-01-06-at-14-00-171.png?w=300\" alt=\"Like and comment counts are shown for every search result in the WordPress.com Reader.\" class=\"wp-image-771\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Like and comment counts are shown for every search result in the WordPress.com Reader.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we know we have connected our users with relevant posts? On WordPress.com, liking posts, commenting, and following sites signify that readers have found content they care for. Additionally, these actions encourage writers on our platform to carry on with their craft. Like and comment counts in the WordPress.com Reader help others to identify the most popular posts. For these reasons, we use likes, comments, and site follows to inform our search engine performance measurement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Types of data for optimization</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Search engines try to find the most relevant posts, documents or websites for every search query. Thus, to measure search engine success, we need to know which documents people perceive the most useful!</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Ideally, we would have human judgments for many documents. These judgments can be obtained in different ways. Following the definitions in Liu\u2019s book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, there are:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/pointwise_datablog_search.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/pointwise_datablog_search.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"Illustration by Sirin Odrowski. \" class=\"wp-image-779\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Illustration by Sirin Odrowski.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Pointwise</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> rankings: judges are presented with a search term and a document and are asked to rank the document\u2019s relevance on a scale. The judgment will always depend on the search query; a great result for \u201cmountain\u201d may not be relevant for \u201cisland.\u201d</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Pointwise ranking provides the richest source of information for search algorithm optimization. It can be used to infer the order of documents by relevance but also informs us how much more relevant one document is than the other.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/listwise_datablog_search.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/listwise_datablog_search.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"Illustration by Sirin Odrowski. \" class=\"wp-image-783\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Illustration by Sirin Odrowski.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Listwise</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> rankings: judges are given a search term and a number of documents. Their task is to sort the documents by relevance with respect to the search term. Unlike in pointwise ranking, they do not need to provide a score for each document.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/pairwise_datablog_search.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/pairwise_datablog_search.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"Illustration by Sirin Odrowski. \" class=\"wp-image-790\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Illustration by Sirin Odrowski.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Pairwise</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> rankings: judges are shown a search term and a pair of documents from which they have to pick the most relevant for the search term.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Of these three options, pairwise ranking is the easiest but provides the least amount of information. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Gathering ranking data from human judges can be time-consuming and costly; hiring people costs money, crowd-sourcing necessitates engineering time to implement quality checks, and asking users to give detailed feedback on search results makes the search interface much more tedious to use.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In internet applications, one can use surf data to replace explicit feedback. Every time a user opens a search result, they are saying \u201cthis is relevant to my search query.\u201d Of course, users will always be biased by the order in which the search results are displayed. Surf data is thus best suited to infer pairwise preferences between documents that were shown directly next to each other on the results page. A bit of randomization to exchange the order of closely ranked documents can help to collect better data.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But, what do we do with a list of pairwise rankings? We use them to derive a set of allowed permutations. Imagine that we have three documents </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">C</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and we know that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">C</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> is more relevant than </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">B</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.

Even with a fairly large number of users, it is possible to end up with a relatively small amount of data per query if the search engine, like ours, displays results as you type. With search-as-you-type, some users may already find what they are looking for before they complete typing their search term.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/pancakes_datablog_search.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/pancakes_datablog_search.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"We offer search-as-you-type in the WordPress.com Reader: The first search results are already shown before the user has completed their request.\" class=\"wp-image-794\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">We offer search-as-you-type in the WordPress.com Reader: The first search results are already shown before the user has completed their request.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As a result, our data contains more search terms but fewer requests per term: </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For every search term that was entered by more than 1,000 unique users in the WordPress.com Reader, 14,000 terms were submitted by only a handful of users.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Aggregate metrics are an alternative when there is not enough data (yet) to make a detailed assessment of the document ordering. For example, when we do not have data for a more detailed study, we look at the rate of users who like or comment or follow a site from one of the top 10 search results.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Whichever metric you choose for your optimization, keep in mind to average over a large number of search terms.

It argues that mainstream media didn\u2019t foresee Trump winning because journalists&#8217; information bubbles were devoid of Trump supporters. I think the analysis is very interesting, mainly because of the breadth of data mined. I especially enjoyed the statistics and visuals on the issues which were most discussed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, over to you: do the results and conclusions here ring true to your experiences following election news? Which platforms did you use most often to consume political news during the election, if any?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Carly Stambaugh</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/carly.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"carly\" class=\"wp-image-717\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8220;<a href=\"https://blog.data.gov.sg/how-we-caught-the-circle-line-rogue-train-with-data-79405c86ab6a#.ku5melewi\">How the Circle Line rogue train was caught with data</a>&#8221; over at Data.gov.sg &#8212; Singapore&#8217;s open data portal &#8212; is a picture perfect example of \u201cusing data to solve real world problems.\u201d It makes for a fun and interesting read, and I like that they provide the code used for their analysis. The outcome of the analysis solved a problem for thousands of daily commuters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Boris Gorelik</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boris.jpg?w=150\" alt=\"boris\" class=\"wp-image-716\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The world is better than you think, and it\u2019s getting better (in many, many aspects). Despite local tragedies that reach enormous scales (such as in Syria right now), the data shows that the world is constantly getting better in many ways. In &#8220;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/a-history-of-global-living-conditions-in-5-charts/\">A history of global living conditions in 5 charts</a>&#8221; at <em>Our World in Data</em>, each chart allows data exploration with smart interactivity. Can you provide reliable data sources that might support or contradict these findings?

I did some digging to learn more about the conference&#8217;s most popular topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corey Chivers&#8217; post, &#8220;<a href=\"https://bayesianbiologist.com/2016/12/07/generative-adversarial-networks-are-the-hotness-at-nips-2016/\">Generative Adversarial Networks are the hotness at NIPS 2016</a>,&#8221; illustrates what Generative Adversarial Networks do.

She&#8217;s a Google <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/\">DeepMind</a> research scientist who is interested in artificial intelligence safety. You&#8217;ll also want to check out this review of Andrew Ng\u2019s lecture \u201c<a href=\"http://www.computervisionblog.com/2016/12/nuts-and-bolts-of-building-deep.html\">The nuts and bolts of Applying Deep Learning</a>.\u201d Lastly, you don&#8217;t want to miss this extensive and informative <a href=\"http://blog.aylien.com/highlights-nips-2016/\">review of the NIPS conference on Aylien&#8217;s blog</a>. Aylien is an artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning startup based in Dublin, Ireland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <em>The Guardian</em>, I appreciated Hannah Devlin&#8217;s piece on bias in machine learning algorithms, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/19/discrimination-by-algorithm-scientists-devise-test-to-detect-ai-bias\">Discrimination by algorithm: scientists devise test to detect AI bias</a>.&#8221; I&#8217;m very interested in whether algorithms are fair and unbiased, and how to find out if they are not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere:</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As a data scientist, I spend a lot of time analyzing&nbsp;how our users interact with WordPress.com. However, WordPress.com isn\u2019t the only place to gain insight into how people use and talk about our services. Many WordPress.org and WordPress.com discussions take place on social media. Analyzing these discussions can help us understand what our users are saying about WordPress<a id=\"ref1\" href=\"#1\"><sup>[*]</sup></a> and Automattic, the topics closely associated with our services,&nbsp;and who is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">leading</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> these discussions.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In every social network, there are people who steer the topic and sentiment of the conversation. These <i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">influencers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> usually have large followings and are positioned centrally within the network. Brands often reach out to influencers to organize focus groups or invite them to events, since they&#8217;re usually knowledgeable about the brand and can offer insight into how consumers use the product and potential improvements.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At Automattic, we don\u2019t do traditional </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_marketing\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">influencer marketing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. However, since the discussions around WordPress in general can offer insight into our users\u2019 experience with our products, I explored the topics, influencers, and ecosystem&nbsp;around WordPress and Automattic products on Twitter. These are the questions I set out to answer:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Who is talking about WordPress and Automattic on Twitter?</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">What are they saying?</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Who are the influencers within the online WP communities?</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This post outlines the main findings of my mini-analysis and emphasizes the need to introduce </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">context</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> into social media analytics.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Data overview</span></h1>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Tweets are public and can be searched and retrieved from Twitter in two ways: via the<a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public\"> REST API</a></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public\">&nbsp;</a> and via the <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview\">Streaming API</a>.&nbsp;(Of course, none of the APIs can access non-public tweets.)</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> I relied on the REST API for this analysis.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">With the REST API, we can track two things: user timelines or search terms. User timelines give us all tweets posted and retweeted by a given user, whereas search term tracking gives us tweets containing specific&nbsp;terms. I used search term tracking over about 10 days to track 13 terms associated with WordPress.com, WordPress.org, and Automattic. The tracking resulted in ~118,000 tweets and ~10,000 unique hashtags. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Who, what, how?</span></h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Topics around WordPress</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A very straightforward way to extract terms from tweets is to just use hashtags. However, if we look at a plot of the top hashtags within our dataset, we see nothing surprising or very enlightening:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/screen-shot-2016-06-30-at-17-38-28.png\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-06-30-at-17-38-28\" class=\"wp-image-588\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This is what I call a </span><b>volume-based approach</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, where the data analysis only looks at the frequency of things (such as how many retweets a user has received, or how many times a hashtag was used) and doesn\u2019t introduce context. A more enlightening approach is to look at relationships formed by hashtags. To do so, I created a network where two hashtags are connected if they appeared in the same tweet together. The&nbsp;more frequently they appeared together, the stronger the connection between them. I also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)\">clustered this network</a></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, so that different </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">topic communities</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> become visible.</span> Note that the image below depicts the breadth of the topic clusters. We zoom in below as we examine specific clusters.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/search_wpcom_cohashnet.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/search_wpcom_cohashnet.png\" alt=\"search_wpcom_cohashnet\" class=\"wp-image-593\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Zooming in, we can see the top terms within this topic network as well as how they are connected to each other to </span><b>distinguish between different contexts</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. The terms form clusters, or closely connected groups. Identifying these clusters helps us to distinguish between different topics&nbsp;of parallel discussions, providing us with a context to understand where certain terms fit within the discussions. For example, we might see that a negative term appears a lot, and might believe that the discussions around WordPress have a negative spin, but when we look at a term network, we could see that the negativity is specific to a single topic cluster.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see four-five larger topics surrounding WordPress and Automattic. Zooming in to the center of the network, we see that the largest topic&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">is about </span><b>business</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and businesses built around the WordPress&nbsp;ecosystem, in purple</span>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/c1.png\" alt=\"c1\" class=\"wp-image-592\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>W</strong><b>riting, </b>in turquoise,<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&nbsp;is a topic that featured prominently in the <a href=\"https://data.blog/2016/09/13/network-science-at-automattic-mapping-the-communities-of-wp-com/\">internal WP.com network</a> as well</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/c2.png\" alt=\"c2\" class=\"wp-image-591\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Then there is a more technical topic around </span><b>competitors</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and </span><b>ecommerce</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> in red:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/c3.png\" alt=\"c3\" class=\"wp-image-590\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Finally, there is a </span><b>net security</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> topic cluster in yellow:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/c4.png\" alt=\"c4\" class=\"wp-image-589\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Looking at hashtags and</span><b> contextualizing terms via networks</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> gives us a lot more insight into the actual topics being discussed as opposed to just looking at top terms or any other approach purely based on volume. We can also prepare tag clouds to look at these topics separately:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Influencers in the conversation around WordPress</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One way of looking at who is talking about WordPress is by plotting the top retweeted tweets and top retweeted tweeters, or maybe even those people who mentioned any of the tracked terms the most times.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-4 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The top retweeted tweeter is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imprincessjones\">@imprincessjones</a></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. However, as we will see, <strong>the context and </strong></span><b>mapping the actual conversation are more important and provide better results than the volume-based approach</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Twitter offers us &nbsp;a very straightforward way to understand who is talking to whom. There are three ways that users can interact with each other: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">replies</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">mentions,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">retweets</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. The following network depicts this conversation flow. By having users as nodes and interactions as edges, each interaction edge is colored differently to show if the user replied to, mentioned, or retweeted another user. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Nodes are sized based on their PageRank, as opposed to number of interactions received. The idea behind PageRank &#8212; in very superficial terms &#8212; is that if I receive 100 retweets but they all come from my uninfluential friends and family then my retweets are worth less than if I received 100 retweets from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The New York Times, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">for example.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/screen-shot-2016-06-30-at-17-39-00.png\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-06-30-at-17-39-00\" class=\"wp-image-597\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It is immediately obvious that a previous \u201cinfluencer\u201d such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imprincessjones\">@imprincessjones</a> is shown to be on the</span><b> periphery of the network </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">and receives interactions only from a set of accounts. This shows that not only context, but also </span><b>position in the network is important</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. This kind of analysis can show </span><b>clusters of users that only interact with each other</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, acting as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">retweet farms</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">They might have high metrics, but when they are put into the big picture, they lose their importance by being forced to the periphery of the network.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We can also see that different </span><b>conversation groups</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> are born; we have the biggest one around <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordpressdotcom\">@wordpressdotcom</a>, which is closely related to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordpress\">@WordPress</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Automattic\">@automattic</a>.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/1.png\" alt=\"1\" class=\"wp-image-596\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We have another large one around <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt\">@photomatt</a></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, Matt Mullenweg (our CEO), as well as themes and ecommerce / woocommerce-led conversations. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/2.png\" alt=\"2\" class=\"wp-image-595\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There are also some smaller but tightly knit conversation groups, such as this one that seems to be between open source developers of WordPress.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/3.png\" alt=\"3\" class=\"wp-image-594\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The network lets us see how <b>the conversations around WordPress are divided into different smaller communities interacting with each other</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, while giving us a list of influential Twitter users we could reach out to, to understand their experiences with our products, or for</span><b>&nbsp;</b>marketing and PR purposes<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This has been an overview of a small part of what kind of analyses can be done using social media data to help PR and Marketing efforts.

    "URL": "https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/2016/11/22/bulk-log-analytics-with-hive/",
    "content": "\n<p>We love data and so do our bloggers, many of whom fastidiously check their stats pages after publishing posts to see how well posts are engaging readers. For this they rely on fast and accurate tracking of visitors and views. At WordPress.com, we serve over <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/activity/\">23 billion pages each month</a>. On the data team, we are responsible for taking a stream of Nginx logs and turning them into those counts of unique visitors and views. We do this for each individual site as well as globally across all sites on a per day, week, and month basis. For all that to work efficiently and quickly, we have&nbsp;a near-realtime pipeline that uses&nbsp;a myriad of technologies including PHP, Kafka, Flume, and various components from&nbsp;the Hadoop ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this automated system works quite well, we occasionally will want to perform custom log analysis or some one-time queries on the raw data. But with tens of billions of log lines a day, simply looking at just a couple of days of data means that we are left to sift through a lot of data. It&#8217;s certainly not something we want to try and churn through on a single server. Luckily, we already have a Hadoop cluster in place for our near-realtime processing so we can tap into the powers of MapReduce to solve this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hive to the rescue</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop. It allows processing of data with SQL-like queries and it&#8217;s very pluggable&nbsp;so we can configure it to process our logs quite easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we will create a Hive table that&#8217;s configured to read raw compressed Nginx logs. To do this, we will instruct Hive to create an external table at the location where we will copy our logs to on HDFS. With the table schema we specify that it is to be stored as <code>TEXTFILE</code> which allows Hive to read the stored files as plain text \u2014 or, for those files with a <code>.gz</code> extension, to be read as gziped plain text. We also want to apply a custom serialization/deserialization (serde) format to each log line so that each line is parsed into columns of data in our table. To do that, we will use the included RegEx serde; it&#8217;s slow, but given it simply applies a RegEx expression to each line in order to extract data, it&#8217;s easily and highly configurable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our create table statement then looks&nbsp;something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<style>.gist table { margin-bottom: 0; }</style><div style=\"tab-size: 8\" id=\"gist29540936\" class=\"gist\">\n    <div class=\"gist-file\" translate=\"no\" data-color-mode=\"light\" data-light-theme=\"light\">\n      <div class=\"gist-data\">\n        <div class=\"js-gist-file-update-container js-task-list-container\">\n  <div id=\"file-hive-nginx-hql\" class=\"file my-2\">\n    \n    <div itemprop=\"text\" class=\"Box-body p-0 blob-wrapper data type-hiveql  \">\n\n        \n<div class=\"js-check-bidi js-blob-code-container blob-code-content\">\n\n  <template class=\"js-file-alert-template\">\n  <div data-view-component=\"true\" class=\"flash flash-warn flash-full d-flex flex-items-center\">\n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" data-view-component=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-alert\">\n    <path d=\"M6.457 1.047c.659-1.234 2.427-1.234 3.086 0l6.082 11.378A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 14.082 15H1.918a1.75 1.75 0 0 1-1.543-2.575Zm1.763.707a.25.25 0 0 0-.44 0L1.698 13.132a.25.25 0 0 0 .22.368h12.164a.25.25 0 0 0 .22-.368Zm.53 3.996v2.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-2.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM9 11a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0Z\"></path>\n</svg>\n    <span>\n      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Hive even <a href=\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF#LanguageManualUDF-StringFunctions\">offers some very helpful functions</a> like <code>parse_url()</code> which we can use to&nbsp;extract parts of the URL or query parameters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While HiveSQL comes with lots of functions, it&#8217;s likely you may have some custom business logic that cannot be handled with pure HiveSQL functions. Fortunately, Hive is super pluggable on the querying side as well and comes with a concept of User Defined Functions (UDFs). With UDFs, we can write arbitrarily complex Java classes that implement a common UDF interface and install it onto our Hive cluster at query time for use. These UDFs will then be distributed across our mappers and executed in parallel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By combining the flexibility of custom deserializers on the parser side with custom UDFs on the query side, we can provide a relatively simple SQL interface that can be used to process TBs of logs without needing to build new complex ETL processes when answering one-off questions or freeform data exploration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve found this post interesting, I also occasionally blog about data engineering over at my own blog, xyu.io, and would recommend you check out this <a href=\"https://xyu.io/2015/07/13/building-a-faster-etl-pipeline-with-flume-kafka-and-hive/\">post about how the ETL process works</a> for WordPress.com.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>The goal of data visualization is to transform numbers into insights. However, default data visualization output often disappoints. Sometimes, the graph shows irrelevant data or misses important aspects; sometimes, the graph lacks context; sometimes, it\u2019s difficult to read. Often, data practitioners \u201cfeel\u201d that something isn\u2019t right with the graph, but cannot pinpoint the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I\u2019ll share the process of visualizing a complex issue using a simple plot. Despite the fact that the final plot looks elementary and straightforward, it took me several hours and trial-and-error attempts to achieve the result. By sharing this process, I hope to accomplish two goals: to offer my perspectives and approaches to data visualization and to learn from other options you suggest. You&#8217;ll find the code and the data used in this post <a href=\"https://github.com/bgbg/plot_evolution_blog_post\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plotting power distribution in the Knesset</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is devoted to a graph I created to explore power concentration in the Israeli Parliament (the Knesset) over time. For context, I\u2019ll share some facts about Israeli politics. The State of Israel was founded in 1948 as a parliamentary republic. The Israeli Parliament is elected based on proportional nationwide representation. For many years, the larger parties claimed that the smaller ones had disproportionately high influence on Israeli politics because governments could only be formed based on fragile multi-party coalitions. In an attempt to solve this issue in 1996, Israeli citizens got the right to select their prime minister in a direct vote. Contrary to the original intent, direct vote for a prime minister spurred small-party growth at the expense of the larger ones, leading to even more stagnation. The legislators reverted the change, but the genie had already left the bottle: the small parties are not small anymore and creating coalitions is harder today than it was in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To explore unequal seat distribution in the Israeli Parliament, I used the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient\">Gini coefficient</a></strong>, which is a metric first used to measure income disparity between people. When all the income belongs to a single entity, the Gini coefficient equals one. When all the assets are equally distributed, the coefficient equals zero. I adopted the Gini coefficient to measure seat disparity over time. In the context of the Knesset\u2019s composition, a high Gini coefficient means few large and strong parties, and some small ones; a lower Gini coefficient indicates a more equal power distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having collected the data, I could start plotting. For graphs in this post, I used <a href=\"http://matplotlib.org/\">matplotlib</a> &#8212; a powerful visualization framework for Python. This is how a default matplotlib plot looks :</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_01.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_01\" class=\"wp-image-483\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I don\u2019t like the aesthetics of the default matplotlib plot, specifically, that the plot area is surrounded by four <em><a href=\"http://matplotlib.org/api/spines_api.html?highlight=spines#\">spines</a></em>. In matplotlib terminology, spines are lines that are drawn around the plot. The default plot has four such spines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A short but important diversion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us divert from the story and talk about data-ink. The term \u201cdata-ink\u201d was defined by Professor Edward Tufte as: \u201cthe non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17744.The_Visual_Display_of_Quantitative_Information\">According to Tufte</a>, &#8220;Ink that fails to depict statistical information does not have much interest to the viewer.&#8221; You may find a short description of this approach, as well as its criticism in <a href=\"https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/sometimes_we_must_raise_our_voices.pdf\">this document</a>, as well as in <a href=\"https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/sometimes_we_must_raise_our_voices.pdf\">this research paper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One example of not using unnecessary &#8220;ink&#8221; is the X axis of our plot. Since most people will immediately recognize numbers such as 1957, 1977, or 2007 as years of the current era, I intentionally didn\u2019t add any labels to that axis, resulting in less &#8220;ink&#8221; used to convey the same information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Improving aesthetics with background color</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us go back to the plot spines. Taking the data-ink ratio principle to the extreme, one might think that the spines provide no useful information and thus, should be removed from any plot. The truth is that the spines form the document\u2019s structure, aiding reading and interpretation. I think that there are better ways to achieve the same goals. One alternative to using spines is to fill the plot area with a pale neutral color. I used <a href=\"https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/\">Seaborn</a> &#8212; a Python visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. By merely importing Seaborn, I improved the plot\u2019s aesthetics:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_02.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_02\" class=\"wp-image-484\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we plan to use the graph in a printed or on-screen document, we may use the same color to fill the entire plot area. By doing so, we help the reader to distinguish between the plot and the accompanying text:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_031.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_03\" class=\"wp-image-500\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I liked the newer version, but there is more that we can do to improve this graph. Between the elections, Knesset seat distribution, and thus the Gini coefficient, remain approximately the same. To reflect this, a step plot is a better choice for the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_041.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_04\" class=\"wp-image-501\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In matplotlib, one of the arguments to the <a href=\"http://matplotlib.org/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes.step\">step function</a>&nbsp;is the step position. I used the <code>post</code> option so that the line bends after the election date. Next, I changed the plot aspect ratio. Since the graph depicts the evolution of a number over time, I feel that the figure\u2019s width should be much greater than its height. Despite the fact that several objective ways to determine plot aspect ratio have been proposed (see for example <a href=\"http://bid.berkeley.edu/files/papers/2006-Banking-InfoVis.pdf\">this paper</a>), I used subjective judgment which resulted in the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_051.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_05\" class=\"wp-image-502\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Readability and Context</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you notice that most plotting libraries use vertical orientation for Y axis labels? This is not merely a matter of taste. Rotated text labels are a serious readability problem: <a href=\"https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~ravin/papers/ecscw2005_textorientation.pdf\">different studies</a> show that rotated text slows short phrase reading by 54% up to 200%.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-full wp-image-513\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/tilted_head.jpg\" alt=\"Dog tilting its head\" class=\"wp-image-513\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/andrea_arden/\">Andrea Arden</a>.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, fixing such a problem is relatively easy with matplotlib:</p>\n\n\n<p>[code language=&#8221;python&#8221;]<br />\nax.set_ylabel(<br />\n&#8216;Knesset seats Gini Index&#8217;,<br />\nrotation=0,<br />\nha=&#8217;right&#8217;, # short for horizontalalignment=&#8217;right&#8217;<br />\n)<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_061.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_06\" class=\"wp-image-503\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will notice that although the Gini coefficient can obtain values between zero and one, I include only the range that represents my data. Such a range restriction is not always the best choice. In our case, however, we are interested in changes over time so the entire theoretical range will provide us no useful information. A much bigger problem is the fact that most people are not familiar with the Gini coefficient. To help them interpret the graph, I changed the legend to something most of us will understand, keeping the technical definition in place:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_071.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_07\" class=\"wp-image-504\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, notice how I reduced the number of ticks on the Y axis. Three ticks are sufficient to provide axis dimensions, as well as to demonstrate the fact that the axis is linear and not, for example, logarithmic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, I wanted to provide better historical context. Traditionally, we tend to make the numbers on our axes (the ticks) equally spaced. However, when the quantity of unique values is small enough, we may use the actual numbers as axis ticks, thus providing more details. In our case, offering such details adds to the viewers\u2019 knowledge of Israeli politics and better connects the graph to other historical events.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_091.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_09\" class=\"wp-image-505\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is, due to political instabilities, there is not always enough time between several election campaigns, resulting in label overlap. Traditionally, the overlap is solved by rotating the labels. However, as we know, rotated labels are hard to read. Instead, I altered the label positions. In matplotlib, doing so is really easy:</p>\n\n\n<p>[code language=&#8221;python&#8221;]<br />\nfor i, l in enumerate(ax.get_xticklabels()):<br />\nif i % 2:<br />\nl.set_y(-0.1)<br />\n[/code]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2026 and the result is a graph with readable, non-overlapping axis ticks. Can you spot the political instability represented by the uneven gaps between the elections?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_101.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_10\" class=\"wp-image-506\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we are almost ready to analyze the effect the direct prime ministerial elections had on how equal (or unequal) seat distribution is inside the Israeli Knesset. To make it easier to locate the relevant election campaigns on the graph, without the need to search Wikipedia, I emphasize the relevant campaigns using a different color:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_112.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_11\" class=\"wp-image-510\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I didn\u2019t use any arrows in my annotation. Instead, I placed the text annotation next to the relevant data and used the same color for both the data and the text. The proximity between the label and the data, as well as the similarity in color, deliver all the required information, without the need to use additional non-data ink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we can clearly see the effect the direct prime ministerial elections had on Israeli politics. During most of Israel\u2019s history before the 1996 change, Knesset seats were distributed between the parties in a significantly unequal fashion, meaning few large parties and some small ones. The direct elections resulted in an increased power for formerly niche parties, at the expense of the historically large factions, resulting in a less centralized power distribution. However, reverting the change did not revert the effect: many voters stayed with the niche parties. To complete the visualization process, I add some explanatory text and a title:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/evolution_of_a_plot_12.png\" alt=\"evolution_of_a_plot_12\" class=\"wp-image-508\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the plot title does not describe the data. Doing so would be an unnecessary duplication and waste of non-data ink. Instead, the title says what the data means, thus guiding the reader to the conclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let us recap the changes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-16-at-12-20-43.png\" alt=\"before and after\" class=\"wp-image-511\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>\n<p class=\"c6\"><strong><span class=\"c7 c9\">Feature</span></strong></p>\n</td><td>\n<p class=\"c6\"><strong><span class=\"c7 c9\">Before</span></strong></p>\n</td><td>\n<p class=\"c6\"><strong><span class=\"c7 c9\">After</span></strong></p>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7 c9\">Chart area</span></p>\n</td><td>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7 c9\">Enclosed by four spines.

However, excessive axis ticks and spines gave us superfluous non-data ink. The rotated label also posed readability challenges. Although not connected to default settings, the original graph\u2019s label text was too technical. Usually, coming up with precise labels that aren&#8217;t too technical is a non-trivial task. It is much easier to write the technical term, hoping that the reader will fill the gap on their own. Also, the original chart lacked the context needed to tell a story to people without the in-depth knowledge of the data and the domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The changes described here are far from trivial. Depending on your technical expertise, these changes may take from 15 minutes to several hours &#8212; even if you know how the final result should look. Is spending several hours for such an improvement a justified effort? It depends. I would not spend this much effort if I had to present the data to my close friends and colleagues who have intimate knowledge of the data and the domain. However, if you want to master your data visualization tool of choice, or if you&#8217;re preparing an important presentation or a blog post, two hours may be worth it. In my case, I see the time I\u2019ve spent on improving this plot as an investment that has already paid off. Thanks to this plot, I have now much deeper knowledge of one of my most essential working tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, over to you &#8212; what techniques can you share based on your data visualization experiments?

When a user </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">creates</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> a post, she can create multiple ties; first, a tie is created </span><b>between the user and the post </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> &#8212; the user authored a post, an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">IS_AUTHOR() </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">type tie is created.

Another tie is created between </span><b>the user and the blog</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> &#8212; the user becomes a contributor to the blog, so an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">IS_CONTRIBUTOR</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> tie is created, and so on.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Whenever a user </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">engages</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> with a piece of content &#8212; meaning likes, reblogs or comments on it &#8212; she creates</span><b> a tie between herself and the post that she engaged with</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. This tie then can be further extended to a relationship between the engaged user and the author of the post, as well as a relationship between the engaged user and the blog that the post appeared on.

    "content": "\n<p>Welcome to the second post in our &#8220;Intro to Search&#8221;-series! Today, we&#8217;ll dig into the building blocks of search engines to give you an idea of just how we identify what posts to show readers using WordPress.com&#8217;s search tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A (web) search engine connects users with relevant documents. This process generally has five main stages:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Document collection:</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Any search engine needs to gather the collection of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">documents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> to operate on. A document can be a website, a scientific paper, a medical record, or a blog post on WordPress.com. Search engines collect these documents either by crawling the web, or directly at the time when a new document is created. The place where they are collected is called a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">document store</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Indexing:</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Among other signals for relevance and importance, search engines use word or term counts. The basic idea is that documents are only relevant to terms that are mentioned in them, and that the more often a word is used in a document, the more important it is in that document. Counting words in a single document is easy, but counting billions of words takes a ton of time. Counting only once and storing the results is much more efficient than counting every time a user searches for something. This storing of term occurrences for each document is called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">indexing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. As part of this process, the indexer may analyze the text to stem words and omit the most common ones. Indexing may condense \u201cAll four species of giraffes have long necks and all giraffes are awesome.\u201d into</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">four</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">1</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">species </span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">1</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">giraffe </span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">2</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">long</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">1</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">neck</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">1</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">awesome</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">1</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">by dividing the sentence into words (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">tokenizing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">), mapping words to their roots (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">stemming</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">), counting, and removing the common words \u201call,\u201d \u201cof,\u201d \u201chave,\u201d \u201cand,\u201d and \u201care.\u201d</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Query Building:</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Whatever a user enters into the search box has to be translated into a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">query</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> that can be run against the document collection. If words are stemmed as part of the indexing process, we have to stem the terms in the search query, too. If very common words are removed before indexing, like in the giraffe example, we have to remove them from the query as well. Queries may or may not take the order of words into account, and they can include synonymous words or allow wildcards.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Ranking:</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Once a set of matching documents have been identified, they have to be put in the best order for presentation. To maximize users\u2019 happiness, we have to show the most relevant, novel, and engaging posts at the top of the list. We\u2019ve covered users\u2019 expectations in the <a href=\"http://data.blog/2016/08/24/intro-to-search-initial-considerations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previous post in this series</a>. There are various well-known ranking algorithms and machine learning solutions for this problem, and we\u2019ll introduce some of the most important ones later in this post.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Presentation: </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Finally,</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">a great search engine needs a clear and clean user interface. Ideally, it makes the search results look inviting while also presenting the user with all the information they need to decide which result to pursue.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Post search in the WordPress.com Reader</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">WordPress.com is home to many publishers, and we continuously integrate the tens of millions of posts they write every month into our searchable document collection. For fast and parallel document access, scalability, and convenient full-text search methods, we use <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elasticsearch</a>. We use Elasticsearch\u2019s built-in indexing methods to make our users\u2019 content searchable, and rely on its own query language to retrieve the right documents for each search. Our largest Elasticsearch cluster has 45 nodes and handles about 35 million queries every day, with a median query time of 130 ms for <a href=\"http://data.blog/2016/05/03/state-of-wordpress-com-elasticsearch-systems-2016/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post searches</a>.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Ranking functions and algorithms</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For a data scientist like me, the most exciting task of a search engine is the ranking. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The ranking of a document can be based on term frequency as a proxy for relevance, or on the importance of a document in a network of documents.

An authority is a page with original, high-quality content about a given topic, and a hub is a page that collects links to authorities. In the WordPress.com universe, a Discover post <a href=\"https://discover.wordpress.com/2016/08/01/portraits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">like this one</a>&nbsp;is a hub, and the sites it links to are authorities on portrait photography. Great hubs link to great authorities, and a great authority is one that is referenced &nbsp;by great hubs.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Each of these algorithms has strengths and weaknesses. Some are susceptible to link spam, and some may just be too well-known to content marketers who could use it to artificially improve a page\u2019s ranking. Many search engines use a combination of these or similar algorithms with a wide range of other features. What exactly they use is often a</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> secret, and for a good reason: a search engine would become useless if publishers and marketers knew the exact recipe to get top rankings.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">What is clear, however, is that the best search engines use continuous testing to improve their algorithms and learn about the relevance of new documents in their collection. In the next post in this series, we\u2019re going to look at how the performance of a search engine is measured, and show a few simple examples of how we\u2019ve improved ours already.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recommended reading and sources:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"literature\" style=\"font-weight:400;\">[1]&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Jones et al, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A probabilistic model of information retrieval: development and comparative experiments: Part 2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, Information Processing &amp; Management 36.6 (2000), pages 809-840</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"literature\" style=\"font-weight:400;\">[2]&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Brin &amp; Page, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine</span></i>, <a class=\"literature\" href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"literature\" style=\"font-weight:400;\">[3]&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Kleinberg, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Authoritative sources in a hyperlinked environment,</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Journal of the ACM (JACM), Volume 46 Issue 5, Pages 604-632, <a class=\"literature\" href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/auth.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a></span></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"literature\" style=\"font-weight:400;\">[4] Manning et al, <em>An Introduction to Information Retrieval</em>, Cambridge UP, 2009, <a class=\"literature\" href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/irbookonlinereading.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pdf</a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"literature\" style=\"font-weight:400;\">[5] Liu, <em>Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval</em>,&nbsp;Springer, 2011</span></p>\n",

A few of these communities contain many blogs, and most of my analysis focuses on the largest communities with the greatest number of blogs &#8212; 15 communities in total. To better characterize these communities, I&nbsp;picked the top 1,000 most-liked posts from each one.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">And now for the most exciting question of all &#8212;&nbsp;<strong>what kind of content are our users producing and reading? Are users searching for and consuming content based on particular&nbsp;topics?</strong> The short answer: yes! The top 15 communities\u2019 most liked posts\u2019 tag clouds are <strong>all very specifically centered around topics and themes</strong>. Blogs with distinct topics seem to cluster together &#8212; i.e., are liked by similar people.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Here are the top 15 English-language communities of

class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Cluster Dynamics (and Controversy!)</span></h1>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>Posts in clusters behave differently</strong>, and&nbsp;looking at likes, comments, and reblogs demonstrates these dynamics. For each blog, I calculated an average number of likes, comments, and reblogs, then took the mean of these averages for each cluster. In the figure below, we can see the mean of the average number of likes, comments, and reblogs that the blogs belonging to a given cluster receive.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I highlighted some of the more interesting figures in bold, such as highly likable communities around writing and photography. But the most interesting part is in dark blue: <strong>a community where the blogs receive more comments than likes</strong>. This is very unusual; since liking is a micro-action, one that takes minimal effort, it is used more widely than commenting. Usually, comments exceed micro-actions&nbsp;when<strong>&nbsp;a topic is controversial</strong> and the platform only allows positive micro-actions&nbsp;(e.g., likes or upvotes) and no negative ones.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong>: It\u2019s the <strong>politics</strong> cluster! This is the moment that made me throw my arms&nbsp;up in the air and exclaim, <em>&#8220;It actually worked!&#8221;&nbsp;</em>Not only do our users congregate into demonstrable, topical communities, but we can also these&nbsp;communities&#8217; differing&nbsp;dynamics.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-full wp-image-156\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"156\" data-permalink=\"https://datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/russian-internal-affairs/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/russian-internal-affairs.png?fit=7000%2C3600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"7000,3600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"russian-internal-affairs\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Russian internal affairs&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/russian-internal-affairs.png?fit=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/datateam0.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/russian-internal-affairs.png?fit=1024%2C527&amp;ssl=1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/dtp_table_dynamics.png\" alt=\"dtp_table_dynamics\" class=\"wp-image-156\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Mean of average likes, comments and reblogs for communities.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Community Distances</span></h1>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A blog can only belong to one community.

Matt started WordPress as a way to organize and showcase his photography, so it looks like we are sticking to our roots! </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One of the advantages of using network science to analyze similarity &#8212; as opposed to text-based methods &#8212; is that<strong> we get to identify non-text based communities like photography</strong>. The graph visualization also tells us that while their topics might look similar, some of the writing communities are actually pretty distinct from each other.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">These communities can now be used in various ways to power recommendations and understand our users and their sites better:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We can <strong>identify top sites per cluster</strong> to help our\u00a0Editorial team <a href=\"https://discover.wordpress.com/\">discover</a> popular posts from a wide variety of communities.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li>It allows us to define <strong>distances between communities</strong> \u2013 e.g., the makeup cluster is a short distance from the fashion cluster.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Community-based characterization serves as a poor man\u2019s <strong>topic modeling</strong>; we can tell what topic a blog might cover by just looking at the community it belongs to. We can do this even when the blog doesn\u2019t have any actual text &#8212; e.g., a photography blog.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It helps us <strong>characterize users</strong> based on which clusters they interact with, so we can <strong>recommend sites</strong> from the same cluster to them &#8212;\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">if you liked this post, we can recommend additional\u00a0posts to you from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">data cluster</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There are many more ways we can analyze these clusters to uncover how they are different or similar, so stay tuned for more analyses on the communities of WordPress.com!</span></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This post is the first in a series about what we learned from developing search products for <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress.com</a>. In this post, I\u2019ll give you a brief tour of some learnings from deploying search in the WordPress.com Reader.</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&nbsp;Improving this search tool to help our users find engaging articles they really like is an effort, and an ongoing learning experience.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screen-shot-2016-08-16-at-15-18-251.png\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-08-16-at-15-18-25\" class=\"wp-image-106\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;WordPress.com<span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Reader is the place where our users can keep up with sites they like, whether they\u2019re personal blogs, high profile sites on&nbsp;WordPress.com, or sites that connect to WordPress.com&nbsp;with <a href=\"http://jetpack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jetpack</a>. In fact, users can <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/reader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">add any RSS feed</a>&nbsp;they like. The list of sites I follow includes <a href=\"https://officetoday.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Office Today</a></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, <a href=\"http://ideas.ted.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TED Ideas</a></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://iso.500px.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">500px ISO</a>&nbsp;as well as several data science blogs.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/screen-shot-2016-08-12-at-14-07-00.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-08-12 at 14.07.00\" class=\"wp-image-42\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Reader is also a great tool for discovering new content, and this is where the search functionality contributes a lot. When we analyzed where our users found new sites to follow, we saw that a quarter of all new site follows originate with the search tool.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Challenges</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At&nbsp;WordPress.com, we have a very large body of documents. There are literally billions of posts on our platform, and it is <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/activity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rapidly growing every day</a></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. We find that Elasticsearch is a great tool to handle all these documents and to make them searchable.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The documents we deal with are also very heterogenous: they cover all kinds of topics. Some are very long, like the ones you\u2019ll find highlighted on <a href=\"https://longreads.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Longreads</a>, and some are photo posts. Some are written by professionals, some by novice writers who are just starting to find their voice. Our authors live in all parts of the world, and they write in many different languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As on any publishing platform, it is only natural that authors try to get as much attention for their sites as possible. At&nbsp;WordPress.com, we offer many tools to promote posts. But when an author crosses the line from self-promotion to spam, we have to protect readers&#8217; interests. We constantly work to balance authors&#8217; interests in promotion with readers&#8217; interest in easily finding the highest quality content.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In addition to mastering these challenges, we have to match our users\u2019 intents and expectations.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Users\u2019 expectations</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Users approach search with different intents [1]. Some are looking for information (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">informational searches</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">). Some want to navigate to a specific site (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">navigational searches</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">), and some wish to perform a transaction, like booking a flight or changing a setting (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">transactional searches</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">). Users expect a search engine to cater to every type of search. In the&nbsp;WordPress.com Reader, we see all three of these search types. However, most searches don\u2019t fit neatly into any category, and are best described as \u201clooking for inspiration\u201d or \u201ckeeping up with a topic.\u201d</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Even though we might each approach a search box with different goals, there are general trends in what most of us hope to find in search results. Broadly summarizing the research of Barry &amp; Schamber [2] and Crystal &amp; Greenberg [3], all of the following are important:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Relevance:</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Most importantly, the results should be relevant to the keywords we entered, especially the first couple of results &#8212; scrolling is tiring, and we form opinions about the quality of the search algorithm itself by skimming through the initial results.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Trust: </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">No one likes being taken to a sketchy site or spammy article.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Originality:</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> We prefer original content on trustworthy sites, ideally written or endorsed by experts in the subject matter. More detailed information is usually preferred over shallow content. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Clarity:</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> At the same time, documents should be written with great clarity and should match our level of understanding; </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">a tourist searching for the term </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Panther </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">might not need the same type of information as </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">a biologist searching for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Panthera onca. </span></i></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Novelty:</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> New content is better than old, outdated documents.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Diversity:</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> A list of search results is most compelling when it includes all possible meanings of the search terms, and contains different views and approaches to the subject. A classic example is the word \u201cjaguar;\u201d if no additional information is given, the search results should contain articles about both the animal and the car.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Top searches</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">To understand our own users\u2019 needs better, we took a look at the top searches after the initial launch of the search box using a <a href=\"https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud/tree/master/wordcloud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">python wordcloud package</a></span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&nbsp;to visualize the 500 most frequent search terms. The bigger the font size, the more users have entered the term.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">(Note: Our search is search-as-you-type: When a user pauses while typing their search request, we return results that match the partial search string. If the user sees what they were looking for in these results, we record only a partial search string.)</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://datadotblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/data_blog_cloud.png\" alt=\"data_blog_cloud\" class=\"wp-image-68\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The top searches contain many broad topics like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">fashion, travel, photography,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">poetry</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. In addition, there are searches related to the website customization and management and blogs on our platform (like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">theme</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">widget</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">). These make up roughly 2% of the total volume of searches in the WordPress.com Reader. Finally, we also see that users search for the work of our editorial team (like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">the daily post</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">).</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These observations highlight that it is important that we continue developing our search engine with our users<em>\u2019 </em> interest in mind. In the next posts in our series <i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Intro to Search</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, we\u2019ll outline the anatomy of search engines in general and ours in particular, and discuss how to measure performance from click data.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recommended reading and sources:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"literature\" style=\"font-weight:400;\">[1] Broder,&nbsp;<em>A taxonomy of web search</em>, AMC SIGIR Forum,&nbsp;Volume 36 Issue 2, Fall 2002, Pages 3 &#8211; 10,&nbsp;<a class=\"literature\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrei_Broder/publication/220466848_A_taxonomy_of_web_search/links/00b7d5187d62e64f2c000000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"literature\" style=\"font-weight:400;\">[2] Barry &amp; Schamber, <em>Users\u2019 Criteria for Relevance Evaluation: a Cross-Situational Comparison</em>, Information Processing &amp; Management Vol. 34, No. 2/3, pp. 219-236, 1998,&nbsp;<a class=\"literature\" href=\"http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/462_readings/Barry.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"literature\" style=\"font-weight:400;\">[3] Crystal &amp; Greenberg, <em>Relevance criteria identified by health information users during Web searches</em>, TOC, Volume 57, Issue 10,&nbsp;August 2006,&nbsp;<a class=\"literature\" href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.65.3855&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"literature\" style=\"font-weight:400;\">[4] Manning et al, <em>An Introduction to Information Retrieval</em>, Cambridge UP, 2009, <a class=\"literature\" href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/irbookonlinereading.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pdf</a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"literature\" style=\"font-weight:400;\">[5] Liu, <em>Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval</em>,&nbsp;Springer, 2011</span></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>We get asked periodically about how extensively we are using Elasticsearch. And it has come up twice in the past week, so time to write a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are constantly expanding what we are using Elasticsearch for and so although <a href=\"https://gibrown.com/2014/01/09/scaling-elasticsearch-part-1-overview/\">some</a> <a href=\"https://gibrown.com/2013/12/05/managing-elasticsearch-cluster-restart-time/\">previous</a> <a href=\"https://gibrown.com/2014/01/09/scaling-elasticsearch-part-1-overview/\">posts</a> have broadly define what we are doing, they don&#8217;t really capture the continually expanding scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here are some quick bullet points about what we currently have deployed:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Five clusters with a mix of versions:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>42 data nodes spread across 3 US data centers running ES 1.3.4. This cluster mostly runs related posts queries. 1925 shards. 11B docs. 43TB of data. 60m queries/day. 12m index ops/day (has been as high as 940m in a day though). Each index is 175 shards and has 10m blogs in it. Each blog is routed to a single shard so almost all queries only hit one shard, but we can (and do) search across multiple shards for some use cases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6 data nodes across 3 DCs running ES 1.3.9. Hosts our <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com VIP</a> indices and lots of other use cases. 321 indices (mostly VIPs). ~8m queries/day. ~1.5m index ops/day. Typical VIP index config is a single shard that is replicated across the three data centers. Most of these indices are small enough that sharding would reduce performance and reduce query relevancy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12 data nodes across 3 DCs running ES 1.7.5. Primarily powers search.wordpress.com. Indexes the past 6 quarters of all posts. One index per quarter with 30 shards per quarter. Queries typically hit all 180 shards.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3 data nodes across 3 DCs running ES 2.3.1. Currently an experimental cluster as we work to migrate to 2.x. Only production index right now is for en.support.wordpress.com.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>15 (and possibly expanding to 100) data nodes for a Logstash cluster running ES 2.3. A lot of logging use cases for many different services. <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/2016/02/08/open-source-netflow-with-elastic-logstash-kibana/\">Growing rapidly</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>All of our clusters use three dedicated master nodes with one master in each data center. The first cluster has its own master nodes. The next three share master servers with multiple instances of ES running on each server.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Typical data server config:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>96GB RAM with 31GB for ES heap. Remaining gets used for file system caching</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1-3 TB of SSD per server. In our testing SSDs are very worthwhile.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Query speed:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Related Posts: median 44ms; 95th percentile: 190ms; 99th percentile: 650ms. This is way lower than when we launched in 2013 and 99th percentile was 1.7 seconds.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>VIP Queries: median: 25ms; 95th percentile: 109ms; 99th percentile: 311ms</li>\n\n\n\n<li>search.wordpress.com queries: median: 130ms; 95th percentile: 250ms; 99th percentile: 260ms</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Client-side Optimizations:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We cache all queries results in memcache which cuts our ES query rate in half</li>\n\n\n\n<li>memcache timeouts vary from 30 seconds to 36 hours depending on use case</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We analyze all queries on the client side and optimize the ES filters:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>have a blacklist of fields that we never cache (blog_id, post_id, author_id) because they have such high cardinality (100m+ unique ids)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>we rewrite and/or/not filters into bool queries and try to flatten them into a single filter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We don&#8217;t allow some types of queries (we have <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/elasticsearch/\">a whitelist</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We don&#8217;t allow facets/aggregations on certain fields (content, title, excerpt)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We generally don&#8217;t allow paging too deep or returning thousands of results at once</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A general pattern we use is to use ES to get IDs for content, and then we get the real content from MySQL for displaying to users. This reduces what data ES needs (we strip out HTML), and we can be certain the data is not out of date since ES can be up to 60 seconds out of date in some cases (though typically is less than 5 seconds).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Query Use Cases (in order of query frequency):\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Related Posts</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/xyu/scaling-wordpress-queries-with-elasticsearch\">Replacing WP_Query calls</a> by converting slow SQL calls to an ES query (WordPress tag/category pages, home pages, etc)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>search.wordpress.com</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Language Detection using ES langdetect plugin (used for every post we index)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Analyze API (used to perform reliable word counting regardless of language &#8211; in conjunction with the langdetect call)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blog Search (replacing the built in WordPress site search)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Theme Search</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search Queries that are used when reindexing content (eg when a blog&#8217;s tag is renamed we need to search for all posts with that tag and reindex them)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Various support searches</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A number of custom VIP use cases</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A number of custom internal use cases (searching our p2s, suggesting posts that may be relevant to read, searching our internal docs, etc)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Calypso /posts and /pages for getting/searching all posts a user has authored across all their blogs (potentially hundreds)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ES Plugins Deployed:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://xyu.io/2014/02/10/whatson-an-elasticsearch-consulting-detective/\">Whatson</a>\u00a0for looking at shard distribution, disk usage, index size, etc</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://xyu.io/2014/08/11/elasticsearch-statsd-plugin/\">StatsD</a>\u00a0for performance monitoring (we also send StatsD data from the client about query speed) See the screenshots of dashboards below.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ICU Analysis</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Langdetect</li>\n\n\n\n<li>SmartCN and Kuromoji Analyzers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Head</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since images are always fun, here are our Graphana dashboards for our largest cluster over the past 6 hours. The first is our client-side tracking of query/indexing/etc speed</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-cloudup wp-block-embed-cloudup\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cfk69syS7m4\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cldup.com/xDuN15ASkY.thumb.png?resize=509%2C512&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screen Shot\" width=\"509\" height=\"512\" /></a>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is our aggregated stats (from the StatsD plugin) about the cluster&#8217;s performance:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-cloudup wp-block-embed-cloudup\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cZXDsJC_PGq\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cldup.com/RYgdu7xUaZ.thumb.png?resize=497%2C512&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screen Shot\" width=\"497\" height=\"512\" /></a>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This cluster/index has been really solid for us over the past two years since it was last built. We have some known issues that have us stuck on 1.3.4, but we&#8217;ve also had times where the cluster went many months without any incidents. In general the incidents we have seen have been caused by external factors (usually over indexing or some other growth in the data).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post was originally published on <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/2016/05/03/state-of-wordpress-com-elasticsearch-systems-2016/\">developer.wordpress.com</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>WordPress.com is a freemium service, meaning that our awesome blogging platform is provided for free to everyone, and we make money by selling <a href=\"//store.wordpress.com/\">upgrades</a>. We process thousands of user purchases each week and you might expect that we know a lot about our customers. The truth is, we are still learning. In this post, we will give you some insights into how we try to understand the needs and behaviors of users who buy upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know there are many kinds of users and sites on WordPress.com. To understand the needs of users who purchase upgrades, one would naturally analyze their content consumption and creation patterns. After all, those two things should tell us <i>everything</i> about our users, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhat surprisingly, the median weekly number of posts or pages a user creates, and the median weekly number of likes and comments a user receives is zero! And I&#8217;m not talking about dormant users. These are our paying customers. There are lots of reasons for this, like static sites that don&#8217;t need to change very often, or blogs with a lower frequency&nbsp;than weekly. But it doesn&#8217;t give us much data to work with. &nbsp;Well, let&#8217;s start with something that IS known about every user: their registration date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thousands of users register daily on WordPress.com. What does the day of the week on which the user registered with us say about their purchasing preferences? Is it possible that users who register during the week are more work-oriented, and users who register during weekends are more hobby oriented? To test this question, we&#8217;ll look at purchases that were made in our online store between March and September 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll divide the purchasing users into two groups: those who registered between Monday and Friday (let&#8217;s call them &#8220;workweek users&#8221;) and those who registered during Saturday and Sunday (let&#8217;s call them &#8220;weekend users&#8221;).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><small><br>\nSide note: To the first approximation, we use registration GMT time to label a user as &#8220;registered on weekend&#8221; or &#8220;registered during the workweek&#8221;. We also ignore weekend differences that exist between the different countries. These are non-trivial approximations that make the analysis simpler and do not invalidate the answer to our question.<br>\n</small></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To examine the purchasing patterns of these groups let&#8217;s calculate the fraction of products purchased. For example the most prevalent products in both categories were [domain mapping and registration](<a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/</a>). These two products, which are usually bought together, are responsible for about 35% of upgrades bought by our workweek and weekend users. Let us now continue this comparison using a graph:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://developer.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/bgbg_correlation_between_purchases.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://developer.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/bgbg_correlation_between_purchases.png?w=300\" alt=\"correlation_between_purchases\" class=\"wp-image-7175\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do we learn from this comparison? Almost nothing. Which is not surprising, as purchasing distribution pattern is mostly determined by factors such as user preferences, demand, price, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look for more subtle differences. We&#8217;ll use a technique known as a <a>Bland / Altman Plot</a>. These British statisticians noted that plotting one value versus another implies that the one on the X axis is the cause, and the one on the Y axis is the result. An alternative implication is that the X axis represents the &#8220;correct value&#8221;. None of these is correct in our case. We are interested in understanding the agreement (disagreement, to be more precise) between two similar measurements when none of the two is superior over another. Thus, instead of plotting the two closely correlated metrics (purchase fractions in our case), we should plot their average values on the X axis and their difference on the Y axis. In this domain, higher X axis values designate more prevalent products, positive Y values designate preference towards the working days and negative Y values designate preference towards the weekend. This is what we get after transferring the fractions to logarithm domain:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://developer.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/bgbg_altman_bland_1.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://developer.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/bgbg_altman_bland_1.png?w=300\" alt=\"altman_bland_1\" class=\"wp-image-7173\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now things become interesting. Let us take a look at some of the individual points:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://developer.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/bgbg_altman_bland_emphesis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://developer.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/bgbg_altman_bland_emphesis.png?w=300\" alt=\"altman_bland_emphesis\" class=\"wp-image-7174\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I have already mentioned, domain mapping and registration are the most popular products. Not surprisingly, these products are equally liked by weekend and working week users. Recall our initial intuition that users who register during weekends will be more hobby-oriented and users that register during the week will be more job oriented. We now have some data that supports this intuition. Of all the products, private registration, followed by space upgrades have the strongest bias towards weekend users. Indeed, one would expect personal users to care about their privacy much more than corporate ones. Being more cost-sensitive, personal users are more likely to purchase space upgrade and not one of <a>plans</a>. The opposite side of the division line makes sense too: blocking ads is the cheapest option to differentiate a workplace site, followed by custom design. These two options are included in all our premium plans, but I can understand how a really small business would prefer buying some individual options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><small><br>\nAnother note: If you are worried about the statistical significance of this analysis, you are completely right. I don&#8217;t show this here, but the same picture appears when we analyze data from different time periods.<br>\n</small></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So what?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As an app developer, you will at some point be frustrated about how little you know about your customers. Don&#8217;t give up! Start with the small things that you know. Things such as day of the week, geographical location and browser version may shed useful light, and you can build out a picture from there, adding to it bit by bit. Having such information is like gardening: it sounds like a lot of work, but you might be surprised at what you can get from a little investment of time. With determination (asking lots of questions) and creativity (looking at a problem from new angles, starting with the information you already have) and the right tools in your hands, you can learn something about your users and grow your garden of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post first appeared on <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/2014/11/30/data-for-nothing-and-bytes-for-free/\">developer.wordpress.com</a>.<br>\n</em></p>\n",
